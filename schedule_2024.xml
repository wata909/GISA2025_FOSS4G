                <abstract>The launch of GRASS GIS in 1984 marked the beginning of open-source geospatial software. Four years later, in 1988, the National Center for Geographical Information and Analysis (NCGIA) established the foundation for GIScience as a distinct academic discipline. Now, after four decades, this talk explores the dynamic interplay between geographical information theory and geospatial software. Like other fields, scientific and technological advancements in geospatial studies are interdependent yet distinct. This discussion will reflect on past interaction points and consider how the relationship between research and practical applications in the geospatial field may evolve.

One of the most significant contributions of GIScience to FOSS4G was the development of point-set topological operators. This work culminated in the dimensionally extended 9-intersection model (DE-9IM), which became the foundation for the Open Geospatial Consortium&apos;s (OGC) simple features model. The resulting standardisation of vector GIS was crucial in preventing the spatial data market from being dominated by proprietary solutions. Open-source tools like PostGIS, Python geopandas, and R-sf emerged as viable, competitive alternatives. The OGC geopackage standard has also been widely adopted for information storage and transfer. Leading researchers engaged directly in developing user-driven tools for spatial analysis, such as GeoDa and R packages like spdep and gstat, further driving innovation in vector GIS.

However, not all GIScience research has had the same practical impact. Topics such as geospatial ontologies, spatial database accuracy, cognitive foundations, and spatiotemporal reasoning have primarily remained within academic circles. While they have enriched theoretical knowledge, their practical applications have been limited. Even concepts that could have benefitted FOSS4G &#8212; such as geospatial algebras and abstract spatial data types &#8212; were overlooked by developers. This talk will explore potential reasons for this disconnect.

Conversely, FOSS4G has made significant contributions to GIScience. Tools like GDAL have enabled researchers to tackle critical scientific questions, while QGIS has become an indispensable tool for scientists. The R spatial packages offer a reliable foundation for new research, and a similar robust foundation is likely emerging in Python.

That said, the relationship between vector-based FOSS4G and GIScience appears to have reached a plateau, with little significant progress on either side in recent years. In contrast, raster-based GIS is undergoing rapid innovation. The availability of petabytes of open Earth observation (EO) data has spurred a new wave of discovery. Space-borne sensors continue to drive technological breakthroughs, but no comprehensive theory exists for modelling and analysing large-scale EO data. This has resulted in fragmented developments like Pangeo, Open Data Cube, OpenEO, and R-sits. The talk will advocate for stronger collaboration between FOSS4G developers and researchers in big EO data analytics, offering potential paths forward.</abstract>

                <abstract>Effective monitoring of forest carbon is essential for accurately estimating carbon emissions, detecting forest degradation, and enhancing forest management practices. This is particularly critical in biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon Rainforest, which not only sequesters vast amounts of terrestrial carbon but is also under constant threat from illegal deforestation and degradation.
In 2023, Planet launched Forest Carbon Diligence, a product that delivers annual global maps of canopy height, cover, and aboveground carbon (AGC) at a spatial resolution of 30 meters, covering the years 2014 to 2023. This initiative has already supported various applications, including a study published by Monitoring by the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), revealing that the Amazon Rainforest stores approximately 56.8 billion metric tons of aboveground carbon (AP News, 2024; Mongabay, 2024).
Building on this foundation, in September 2024, Planet introduced Forest Carbon Monitoring, a groundbreaking product that offers a global map of canopy height, cover, and AGC with a remarkable spatial resolution of 3 meters, updated quarterly. This enhanced capability allows for more detailed analysis of forest dynamics, providing timely insights into forest conditions and changes.
This talk will address two primary objectives:
Technical Insights: I will cover the development and validation of Forest Carbon Monitoring, highlighting its intercomparison with other existing products. Beyond providing quarterly snapshots, this system enables near-real-time monitoring of landscape changes, comparable to alert systems like RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) and Global Forest Change datasets. I will demonstrate how this tool is instrumental in identifying deforestation activities and directing conservation efforts to the most vulnerable areas of the Brazilian Amazon.
Community Engagement and Collaboration: In this segment, I will illustrate Planet&apos;s commitment to fostering community engagement and collaboration through several key initiatives:
1.	Open-Source Contributions: Planet actively collaborates with the Free Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS) community by using and contributing to open repositories such as pystac, GDAL, xarray, and Dask. This open-source approach encourages innovation, enhances tool accessibility, and supports diverse applications for the geospatial community.
2.	Partnerships for Impact: Our collaboration with Santiago &amp; Cintra Consultoria (SCCON) in Brazil exemplifies the power of partnership. In the past year, Planet data assisted Brazilian Federal police agents in executing over 3,000 interventions to combat illegal activities, resulting in a remarkable 50% reduction in deforestation rates. This partnership not only strengthens law enforcement efforts but also builds local capacity for sustainable forest management.
3.	Inclusive Access Programs: Planet offers initiatives like the NICFI and Education and Research programs, which provide users with free access to Planet data. By democratizing access to critical information, we empower researchers, conservationists, and local communities to utilize our data for informed decision-making and collaborative conservation efforts.
Through this presentation, I hope to engage the audience in a dialogue about the crucial intersection of technology, conservation, and community involvement, underscoring the vital role of precise forest carbon monitoring in addressing global environmental challenges.</abstract>

                <abstract>Community standards are specifications that are created through informal organization and are then widely adopted by a larger group. The STAC specification and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs are examples of community specifications that have become de facto standards for geospatial interoperability. This talk will examine how the process of developing community standards differs from traditional standards development and how to drive adoption. Numerous examples of successful community standards will be presented.

In addition, we will provide a case study of a current effort - that of STAPI - a specification for satellite tasking, or more specifically, an API for how users can order data from the future from satellite platforms. We have been spearheading an effort to develop such a specification and after two sprints we presented at the last FOSS4G in Kosovo.  This prompted a third sprint in Europe, bringing together an even larger community.  Working with government groups, commercial satellite operators, and data integrators, these sprints have worked toward developing a specification as well as implementations for several commercial providers, as well as ordering APIs for public datasets.

This talk will dive into what worked for STAC and other community standards and how we are taking those lessons to develop a standardized way for collecting future geospatial data.</abstract>

                <abstract>The development community is really excited about having modern (REST and JSON) protocols for geospatial data infrastructure. While we love the traditional WMS and WFS protocols, the heavy use of XML is a barrier to today&#8217;s developers and tool chains.

GeoServer is enthusiastically pursuing these standards thanks to the efforts of Andrea Aime and other volunteers at the joint OSGeo / OGC code sprints. The GeoNetwork team has also attended these events to work on record management.

* This presentation looks at the approach used by the OGCAPI family of protocols.
* We also look at how OGCAPI Features works in more detail, as one of the first standards to be finalized.
* We check in with OGCAPI Records and the progress made by the GeoNetwork team
* We look at the OGCAPI standardization process, and what features we are looking forward to being finalized
* Looking ahead to what is needed for OGCAPI support in GeoServer to be successful

Jody and Gabe are enthusiastic GeoServer developers really using this presentation as an excuse to work on these new protocols.

Attend this talk to learn about the transition to OGCAPI Protocols and help your organisation plan for the future.</abstract>

                <abstract>Wow it has been a busy year for security vulnerabilities. While FOSS4G software is unlikely to result in global &#8220;blue screen of death&#8221; outages - we are getting caught up in the general push to regulate IT and impose &#8220;security&#8221; on the technology that powers society.

This talk unpacks what this can look like for foss4g projects using real world examples. 

* Built around the experience of the GeoServer project, and the resulting security policy and practices that can serve as a template for our foss4g community.
* Public institutions can attend this talk to learn how their security policies interact with and affect foss4g technologies.
* Vendors and service providers can learn how open source supply chains affect their products.
* FOSS4G projects can attend to learn how to approach security reports with compassion, and a bit of boundary setting, to take care of your codebase and community.

This talk explores the tensions, expectations, terrors and triumphs on this hot button topic.</abstract>

                <abstract>The ever-increasing volume of geospatial data presents challenges in discovery, access, and utilization. The Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) standard offers a standardized approach to describing and accessing spatiotemporal assets. This talk explores the integration of STAC with QGIS.
We describe the benefits of STAC integration, including improved data discoverability through user-friendly search functionalities, streamlined access to remote data sources, and potential for automation in data download and processing workflows within QGIS.
The talk outlines the technical approach for integrating STAC, which involve developing a new servevice provider within core QGIS. We discuss potential challenges, such as ensuring compatibility with various STAC implementations and data providers.
Finally, the talk highlights the potential impact of STAC integration. By leveraging the STAC ecosystem, QGIS users can benefit from a wider range of geospatial data resources, enhancing their ability to conduct spatial analysis and create insightful maps.</abstract>

                <abstract>FAIR principles are a set of best practices aimed at making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable to both humans and machines. The growth of spatial data infrastructures and discovery catalogs (aka &#8216;geoportals&#8217;) have highlighted the importance of geospatial data management, metadata, and systems architecture. These data are invaluable to public, private, and academic sectors for use in decision-making, policy development, research, as well as subsequent data production. However, the costs and overall effort associated with the curation of data throughout their lifecycle can be substantial. The Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure implements FAIR principles to its collections of geospatial data in order to better meet the needs of its researchers and worldwide user community. These principles are applied to data, metadata, and infrastructure, and serve as a guide for collecting, organizing, and managing data that are produced through research endeavors, published by public entities for open consumption, or created by vendors for commercial purposes.

In this presentation, the design and implementation of a geospatial data curation strategy utilizing FAIR principles will be described. Additionally. we will discuss our efforts around automation in data wrangling and metadata, as well as access, licensing, and digital preservation.</abstract>

                <abstract>[Shortbread](https://shortbread-tiles.org/) is an open schema for OSM vector tiles. It is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector tile schema for OpenStreetMap data.

For creating and extending OSM vector tiles, workflows using [Tilemaker](https://tilemaker.org/), [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) and [osm2pgsql Themepark](https://osm2pgsql.org/themepark/) are compared.

Since vector tiles are styled in the browser, the styling can be changed at runtime. This talk shows the tooling for customizing styles, but also goes into extending vector tile content with additional data for special interests.</abstract>

                <abstract>**DigiAgriApp** is an free and open-source client-server application designed to manage a wide variety of data. This data can be collected either manually or directly from sensors. 
The application is composed  of various open-source components such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS and  Django for the back-end, Flutter for the front-end, and a plugin for QGIS to manage geometries. 
Over the past year, since its first presentation in Kosovo, DigiAgriApp has undergone many improvements and gained new features. Users can now save data from measurements and observations made in the field. Moreover, a new component has been added to manage production data, particularly data collected by sorting machine, allowing the possibility to perform some simple analysis. Other improvements on the  client-side include the possibility of assigning different aspects (such as death, an observation or measurement) to one or more plants. The QGIS plugin allows to manage the geographical components of the database, primarily fields, subfields, rows and plants. The latest innovation is the integration of artificial intelligence, thanks to a new project funded by the Fondazione Valorizzazione della Ricerca Trentina. Specifically machine vision algorithms have been incorporated to analyze images and provide extrapolated values. The first application of the model is able to recognize the presence of Scaphoideus Titanus, a vector responsible for spreading the Flavescence dor&#233;e disease, which poses a potential threat to vineyards, on a pheromone photochromic trap.
During our presentation we will showcase the first adoption of the application within FEM covering about 15 hectares and more than 20000 plants to demonstrate the application&#8217;s functionalities.</abstract>

                <abstract>Forest ecology research often requires detailed forest inventory data at the individual tree level, but such data are time-consuming and costly to collect using traditional ground-based manual survey methods. Recent advances in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones), image processing, and deep learning are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and taxonomically identified across broad areas without extensive ground surveys. The Open Forest Observatory (OFO; openforestobservatory.org) is a new multi-institution organization that makes cutting-edge forest mapping tools and data accessible to ecologists and practitioners without extensive specialized computing background. Open-source OFO tools simplify and automate tasks including: (a) processing drone imagery into 3D canopy models and stitched imagery mosaics, (b) performing individual tree detection, geospatial crown delineation, and height measurement from drone-derived canopy height models, and (c) obtaining taxonomic classification of detected trees from raw drone images (including multiple views of each tree) using deep learning and 3D geometric reasoning. The OFO also hosts an extensive public database of raw and processed drone imagery from western U.S. forests (&gt; 35 km2) across broad gradients in forest structure, species composition, and disturbance history, and &gt; 100 field-based individual tree maps used for developing and validating the drone-based mapping tools. The growing database is available to host community-contributed datasets from forests globally. In relatively challenging (dense and structurally complex mixed-conifer forest conditions, current OFO overstory tree detection algorithms achieve precision and recall of 70-90%, and current tree height estimation achieves R2 of 0.95. In a challenging cross-site task, preliminary tree species classification using OFO multi-view computer vision tools achieved 76% accuracy across five species, compared with 54% accuracy of a baseline using a single top-down view from a stitched imagery mosaic. All tools and data are free for use by anyone to address ecology questions or build on the tools, and the OFO welcomes collaborations and contributions to data and code. Some current development priorities include (a) expanding multi-view mapping tools to support tree detection using computer vision, (b) optimizing tree detection and species classification algorithms across broad gradients of forest structure and species composition, and (c) developing cloud-native workflows for automated cataloging and processing of contributed drone-based and field-based forest data.</abstract>

                <abstract>The summer of 2024 saw extreme floods and landslides in Switzerland, significantly affecting the Ticino, Grisons and Valais regions.
This talk examines the critical role of QField&apos;s new plugin framework in complementing the aerial rapid mapping effort with crowdsourced oblique (terrestrial) imagery. We will discuss a quickly built proof-of-concept (POC) project that used QField&apos;s new customizable plugins, allowing first responders, civil protection agencies, and citizens to map and report damages efficiently. The session will introduce the plugin framework, its easy deployment through QFieldCloud, and its possible impact on field data collection workflows in enterprise and community settings.</abstract>

                <abstract>The PostgreSQL extension for Hydrographic Applications Project (PgHydro) represents the first innovation of intelligence as an extension of spatial database management systems for use in water resources management that uses the sub-catchment network model and the logic elements present in the Pfafstetter basin coding system. PgHydro aims for an add-on implementation of a spatial database management system performed by a series of tables, queries, functions, or views that can be used individually to assist in water resources decision-making. These objects are the hydrography core of the intelligence system developed using free open-source software that can be used by anyone dealing with water resources management. To this end, this new conceptual model was implemented in the object-relational spatial database management system PostgreSQL/PostGIS, respecting the integrity constraints related to the geometry of the mapped objects. These user-defined constraints respect the logical objects based on the Pfafstetter basin coding system and integrity constraints linked to the spatial relationships between objects, which follow the ISO SQL/MM specifications. The main advantage of using the pghydro extension is the possibility to process large datasets and complex queries using a simpler hydrography model and the tools and languages already available in spatial database management systems that work as a framework for the future development of new extensions related to water resources.
The pghydro functionalities can be run using a GUI developed in a QGIS plugin called PgHydro Tools. After the physical implementation of the pgHydro Scheme in the spatial database management system, the construction of the Pfafsteter hydrography dataset is started using the hydrography objects that make up the pgHydro Tools. The construction of this base is divided into seven stages: 1) Creation of the spatial database and creation of the pghydro extension; 2) insertion of the drainage lines and the drainage areas in the spatial database; 3) verification of the consistency of the drainage network geometries and topologies; 4) verification of the consistency of the drainage areas geometries and topologies; 5) verification of the consistency of topology between the drainage network and the drainage areas; 6) Pfafstetter basin coding and other information, finally; 7) export of the final Pfafstetter hydrography dataset. Optional steps are the systematization of river names and the management of the multiuser edition.
Last year, the pgh_raster was developed, which allows the insertion of the digital elevation model and products derived from it, such as drainage direction and flow accumulation. Functions allow retrieving the downstream or upstream pixel given a position as well as the elevation profile along a given specific geometry.
Another extension developed for pghydro was the pgh_hgm, a hydrogeomorphometric extension used to calculate information such as minimum and maximum elevation, slope, concentration time, time travel, and others related to drainage geometry and digital elevation. The pghydro project is officially and widely used by the National Water and Sanitation Agency of Brazil as a reference for the Brazilian Water Resources Management.</abstract>

                <abstract>Collecting data in the field has become an essential task in most geospatial workflows. Geospatial data collection using mobile applications is expensive because it involves human effort, and several considerations need to be taken into account. Geospatial professionals should ensure high-quality data so that the capital effort employed yields reliable results, as collected data often represents an input for downstream processes. 

This talk will share practical insights and experiences from a fieldwork project conducted in Mozambique for agricultural applications using QField and QField Cloud. It will illustrate from practical examples how to effectively set up forms, capture EXIF information from photos, and navigate the constraints encountered during fieldwork. The presentation will provide user-level tips and tricks to maximize the potential of these powerful tools for geospatial data collection and management.

The talk will also summarize the most important lessons learned from a recent experience in Mozambique by describing common issues encountered during fieldwork in remote areas,  solutions or workarounds for overcoming these challenges, and some recommendations for fieldwork data collection design. The showcase focuses on agriculture; however, practical examples apply to any tool that uses QGIS forms.</abstract>

                <abstract>GeoParquet (https://geoparquet.org/) is a cloud-native format created to address the geospatial interoperability issues between data warehouses. It is based on the widely supported columnar storage Apache Parquet (https://parquet.apache.org/), extending it to add support for geometry data types (e.g.: points, lines and polygons). Although a relatively recent format, it already has a good ecosystem of tools, and it took Standardisation very seriously by joining the path to become an OGC Standard (https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet).

The eMOTIONAL Cities project (https://emotionalcities-h2020.eu/) aims to understand how the natural and built environment can shape the feelings and emotions of those who experience it. At its core, lies a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), which combines a variety of datasets from the Urban Health domain (https://emotional.byteroad.net/). These datasets should be available to urban planners, neuroscientists and other stakeholders, for analysis, creating data products and eventually making decisions based upon them. To support an efficient analysis, especially of the larger datasets, we have decided to offer GeoParquet as an alternate encoding. In this talk we share our experience, converting and publishing the +90 datasets of the eMOTIONAL Cities SDI using a stack of FOSS/OSGeo software (GDAL, gpq, pygeoapi).

We will show that there is already a set of (FOSS) tools in place (e.g.: readers, writers, validators) to support this task and to encourage others to add a Standards-based cloud-native format to their SDIs.</abstract>

                <abstract>Every geospatial project begins with a quest for answers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how we can directly understand user needs through techniques like natural language to data structure conversion. Over the couple years, we have been exploring how AI could be used for working with geospatial data. What started as figuring out how to use natural language to make STAC queries to find public data has led to much more, including natural language geocoding to contextual image searching of public data such as NAIP and Sentinel-2.

In this talk we will explore how AI can be used to help automate some of geospatial&#8217;s most tedious tasks using open data, and how open vision models can be combined to create powerful tools for search &amp; discovery of earth imagery.

This talk will include an overview of AI for use in geospatial analysis, with a focus on using open data and open models. We will show some live demos to create accurate AOIs with natural language, as well as for advanced searching of landscape features in public datasets. Additionally we will give an overview of techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLM Agents and the potential for how these may be used to transform geospatial data science.</abstract>

                <abstract>In the planning and expansion of water supply schemes, there needs to be detailed mapping and documentation of existing pipeline network and their assets. However this is usually not the case, especially where the construction of these pipelines predates advances in mapping, geoinformation and database where they in prior existed as drawing and engineering plans. In order to migrate to a fully documented inventory, digitalisation and management of a water supply network database to estimate demand and supplies to plan expansion and population growth, there needs to be an inventory of existing scheme. Historically, mapping has been done with expensive mapping and survey equipment that can pose a challenge for small organisation&#8217;s budget, making it difficult to have a complete mapping inventory of its network.
This article presents a geographical information system&#8211;based free and opensource software architecture for the mapping and inventory of urban water supply network. This architecture is especially useful where budget is tight and decision relating to meeting the water and sanitation-related Sustainable Development goals needs to be made. The architecture consists of data management, data collection, data analysis and project host environment tools and software.
PostGresSQL with PostGIS was used for design and management of water supply network GIS database, basing the creation and design of features and attributes on prior knowledge of what exists on water supply networks. Features created are transmission and distribution pipelines, hydrants, valves, chambers, junctions, leaks, encroachments, pumps, pump stations, reservoirs, bulk flowmeter, treatment stations with attributes across that include diameter, pipeline material, operational status, condition, encroachment, photo; sizes, capacity, models, manufacturer etc. The PostGIS database was connected to a QGIS project environment where custom forms to were designed to capture attributes created in PostGIS. The QGIS project was linked to an android based mobile app data collection software called Qfield, hosting custom forms designed in QGIS to capture the content of the water supply features, location and attributes. Using the form on Qfield, the water supply network is mapped and attributes captured and once data capture has been carried out using Qfield software, data from field capture is synchronised to QGIS project and following edits to the data captured, it is updated to the PostGresSQL PostGIS database. QGIS software acting as the project host environment also functions as the software for mapping, visualising and analysis of data hosted and managed
The architecture presented is an opportunity for any organisation seeking a free and open source GIS option in capturing and documenting and managing their water supply network data. As one of the weaknesses, is that data captured using Qfield has the inherent horizontal and vertical accuracy acquired from android devices which is less accuracy than that from a survey equipment. However, Qfield has the option of connecting to GNSS equipment by blue tooth, inheriting the sub cm horizontal and vertical accuracy it offers and thus improving locational and elevation information and still offering a higher accuracy free open source option.</abstract>

                <abstract>At  the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we are working on a group of free and open source tools for community creation of maps. Following a process that involves aerial imagery gathering with UAVs, remote volunteer mapping, community in-the-field data collection, AI assisted remote sensing, and finally, downloading and using the map in disasters and humanitarian work. This is an end-to-end (E2E) solution that benefits everyone, from a small community to a big organization. We want to tell the story about how we&#8217;re creating and using these tools and what could be the future of humanitarian and disaster mapping from an open tech and data perspective. 

We hope that you leave this talk inspired and excited about becoming part of the end to end mapping journey!</abstract>

                <abstract>The IS_Agro project is an initiative focused on the critical evaluation and subsequent adaptation of methodologies designed in global forums, with a view to their application in the national context based on the development of new agro-socio-environmental metrics and indicators (IASs) that aim to provide a more accurate and authentic representation of the agricultural landscape in the national territory. IASs are measures used to monitor and evaluate agricultural performance related to social, economic and environmental aspects, thus having great importance in guiding more sustainable political strategies and agricultural practices, whether by the public or private entity, serving &#8220;to evaluate the performance of agriculture in terms of its environmental, social and economic performance, providing comparative data and information between federative entities or countries, among several other applications&#8221; (EMBRAPA SOLOS, 2023). In this project, IASs are developed by different teams specialized in the proposed themes, whose works are previously approved and published in the scientific arena. To automate data collection, allocation, calculations and constant updates of the IASs, there is a team called the Digital Module, which develops solutions for each indicator, transforming them into digital algorithms. Structured, semi-structured and unstructured registration data are collected and stored in a data lakehouse, requiring a great deal of organization within the repository so that the data is always available and easily accessible. It was decided to implement the medallion architecture (medal architecture), which consists of allocating data in three layers with different purposes, while an open source platform was used for pipeline management and automation.

The conception of this project as a digital platform linked to the Brazilian Agricultural Observatory aims to publish indicators and parameters derived from well-founded technical and scientific data, capable of evaluating the effective performance of the national agricultural sector at the municipal or state level, contributing to sectoral policies and planning and management processes aimed at building sustainable agriculture and the correct positioning of the country on the international scene. Thus, the general objective is to develop an intelligent environment that automates and manages the IAS pipelines in a data storage organization environment based on the medallion architecture to be the basis of the data panel for publishing the indicators.

A data pipeline is a succession of connected phases that enable the collection, storage, modification, analysis, and representation of data, with the purpose of acquiring meaningful insights and supporting informed choices (CALANCA, 2023). A data lakehouse, the destination of the project pipelines, is &#8220;like a modern data platform built from a combination of a data lake and a data warehouse&#8221; (ORACLE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, 2023), using &#8220;the flexible storage of unstructured data from a data lake and the management capabilities and tools of data warehouses, and then strategically deploying them together as a larger system&#8221; (ORACLE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, 2023). The medallion architecture is the sequential structuring of data storage that aims to logically organize the data in the lakehouse, aiming to incrementally and progressively improve the structure and quality of the data as it flows through the three layers of the architecture (ARQUITETURA medallion, 2024). The terms bronze (raw data from the source), silver (transformation and validation of the data), and gold (refined and enriched data for use in projects) describe the quality of the data during the process (SKAYA et al, 2024) . Pipeline management is performed by Apache Airflow (version 2.44), an open-source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows based on the Python programming language, which allows you to create workflows connected to virtually any technology (WHAT is Airflow&#8482;?, 2023). The Airflow execution environment was structured in Docker, an open-source platform that allows you to create and manage containers as modular virtual machines that contain the essentials for their execution. The developed image is available on GitHub.
To be confirmed, the routines will be executed once a month. Raw data is collected by downloading and maintaining its original format, with a hash of each file being recorded to indicate that the data has been updated and download it again in the event of a change. This data is cleaned and processed as needed. At the end of the silver phase, a tabular structure will be created with geocode (integer, IBGE code of municipalities or states), date (timestamp, ISO 8601), source (text) and value (floating point, real number) and will be saved in the data lakehouse as .parquet, an open-source columnar storage format designed for highly compressed storage and efficient data retrieval, providing improved performance for handling complex mass data (OVERVIEW, 2022). The .parquet files saved in the data lake are available for use in the gold tier with one-to-many cardinality. In this last phase of the architecture, the necessary calculations are performed for each source of the indicators, with some sources that do not require calculations. The final phase is with the export of the gold data to tables in a project database in PostgreSQL, being ready for use by an API developed internally that allows the provision of data for the data panel to be developed (by another team) and published to society from the project website.

This model has been adjusted and corrected throughout the development of the project in the Digital Module. Flexible, it is now considered ready to receive any indicator developed by other teams, as well as the development of the data panel for publication for use by society.</abstract>

                <title>It&apos;s not broken... but fix it anyway. Customizing FOSS4G Tools for Government: The Inteligeo Case Study</title>

                <abstract>This talk presents a case study of Inteligeo, an adaptation of GeoNode for Brazilian government agencies. We&apos;ll share our journey in taming a 170TB raster dataset and other adventures in customizing open-source geospatial tools. We outline the experience of four agencies: The National Water Agency (ANA), the Center for the Surveillance of the Amazon (CENSIPAM), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBIO), and the Federal Police (PF).

The project, which began in 2009 using proprietary software, transitioned to open-source in 2017. To address limitations and support multiple agencies, we ported Inteligeo version 4 functionality to GeoNode, creating Inteligeo 5 in 2022. Each agency has a unique perspective: PF was involved from the start, CENSIPAM deployed for internal use, ANA for external use, and ICMBIO is integrating it into their processes.

Why customize at all? Why not just use the software as it is? Why not develop it from scratch? There are several reasons why one should (and shouldn&apos;t) customize, and then there are several ways how to do it right once you commit to it. We share our experiences: the good and the bad, and the lessons learned, when customizing GeoNode for the Brazilian government.

Why customize?
- Get shiny new functionality!
- Jump-start development
- Optimize processes with tailored deployments and workflows
- Integrate with existing systems and infrastructure (authentication, 170TB raster storage, Brasil Mais imagery)
- Comply with internal and government standards

Challenges:
- Non-standard deployment
- Training and documentation
- Balancing customization with community support
- Syncing with upstream changes
- Managing a huge codebase with extra stuff that you don&apos;t need

How to do it right (aspirational):
- Seek sponsorships (SGD/MGI, JICA, FINEP, INTERPOL)
- Selfless and selfish reasons to contribute back to the community
- Have a clear strategy for upstream syncing
- Keep it simple. Minimize customization to essential features
- Design independent, standalone components
- Engage upstream developers when possible

Our experience is particularly relevant to the Amazon region, as the tool directly supports the Federal Police surveillance and conservation efforts in the area and is being integrated by the agencies of the other speakers.

                <abstract>The State of California has a recurring issue of devastating wildfires that spread out of control, causing significant damage to the well-being of its citizens, environment, and economy.

Due to this recurring issue, the State of California and the USDA&#8212;United States Forest Service committed to treating one million acres of land (roughly 400,000 hectares) to reduce the occurrence and severity of these wildfires. Planscape was created to prioritize and guide this one million-acre effort.

Planscape is a freely available tool built to help landscape planners, public agents and the general public prioritize and learn about landscape interventions that minimize fire risk and cost while maximizing ecological benefits. 

Planscape utilizes zonal statistics data gathered from over 200 raster layers, applying Linear Programming techniques to determine the best locations for planners to intervene in the landscape by performing treatments such as mastication, prescribed burns, etc.

This hands-on session will discuss several options for obtaining Zonal Statistics for Planscape. In this benchmark, we can compare a diverse range of technologies and techniques utilized to reduce the necessary time to obtain zonal statistics for roughly 24 million regular polygons covering the state of California and, over 200 million zonal statistics records.

This talk benchmarks the following methods: PostGIS + PostgreSQL, Python RasterIO, rasterstats, custom code.</abstract>

                <abstract>Soar is an online atlas of maps, free and open. Our mission is to make maps publicly accessible.  
Our goal is to bring together every map, satellite, and drone image that has ever existed, or will ever exist, in one place. 
Therefore, it is aimed at both lay people who appreciate maps and professionals.
Soar is a collaborative platform: maps come from both organizations and individuals.
For greater interactivity, we have created map editing tools and a QGIS-Soar integration plugin.
We propose to show in this short talk how to access and build upon the multitude of open data maps on Soar catalog using Soar-QGIS Plugin.</abstract>

                <title>GeoHealthCheck - QoS Monitor for Geospatial Web Services</title>
                <subtitle></subtitle>
                <type>Talk</type>

                <abstract>Keeping (OGC) Geospatial Web Services up-and-running is best accommodated by continuous monitoring: not only downtime needs to be guarded, 
but also whether the services are functioning correctly and do not suffer from performance and/or other Quality of Service (QoS) issues.
GeoHealthCheck (GHC) is an Open Source Python application for monitoring uptime and availability of OGC Web Services.
In this talk we will explain GHC basics, how it works, how you can use and even extend GHC (plugins).

There is an abundance of standard (HTTP) monitoring tools that may guard for general status and uptime of web services. 
But OGC web services often have their own error, &quot;Exception&quot;, reporting not caught by generic HTTP uptime
checkers. For example, an OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS) may provide an Exception as a valid XML response or
in a error message written &quot;in-image&quot;, or an error may render a blank image. 
A generic uptime checker may assume the service is functioning as from those requests and an HTTP status &quot;200&quot; is returned.

Other OGC services may have specific QoS issues not directly obvious. A successful and valid &quot;OWS GetCapabilities&quot; response may not 
guarantee that individual services are functioning correctly. For example an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) based on a dynamic database may 
return zero Features on a GetFeature response caused by issues in an underlying database. Even standard HTTP checkers supporting &quot;keywords&quot; 
may not detect all failure cases. Many OGC services will have multiple &quot;layers&quot; or feature types, 
how to check them all?

What is needed is a form of semantic checking and reporting specific to OGC services!

GeoHealthCheck (GHC) is an Open Source (MIT) web-based framework through which OGC-based web services can be monitored. GHC is written in 
Python (with Flask) under the umbrella of the GeoPython GitHub Organization. It is currently an OSGeo Community Project. 

GHC consists of a web-UI through which OGC service endpoint URLs and their checks can be managed, 
and monitoring-results can be inspected, plus a monitoring engine that executes scheduled &quot;health-checks&quot; on OGC service endpoints. 
A database stores results, allowing for various forms of reporting.

GHC is extensible: a plugin-system is available for &quot;Probes&quot; to support an expanding number of 
cases for OGC specific requests and -checks. Work is in progress to provide a GHC API for various integrations.

                <abstract>HOT&apos;s LAC hub dedicates an important part of its activities to foster mapping and collaborative projects in the Amazon, with different academic and civil partners, and with the regional Openstreetmap community including its large student community, in continuity with OSM-Latam&apos;s Mapazonia initiative. 
The Amazonia Program is a multifaceted initiative that addresses mapping gaps and promotes social impact mapping in the region. Partnerships with disaster risk management, civil protection and municipal development authorities aim to fill mapping gaps and improve the risk management and sustainable development, including preservation, of this critical region for the world. Early mapping identifies vulnerable areas to improve planning and response and make degradation processes visible. The community projects teach mapping and support environmental monitoring in several Amazonian cities and communities in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, fostering local engagement and open data ownership.
The set of projects develops technical competencies with the great diversity of actors that have a role in the management of their territory (governments, communities, ancestral governments, civil society, supported by universities), based on the use of free and collaborative geographic data (OSM) and &#8220;low tech&#8221; mapping and monitoring tools, also free, culturally relevant, and with low connectivity requirements. 
In this talk we will explain the long term strategy to map the Amazon, will exemplify different projects, show the challenges for the region, and show the different mappings that the audience can join and invite their own communities.
This talk will serve as an introduction to a practical activity that will be proposed to contribute to the mapping of Bel&#233;m.</abstract>

                <abstract>Fisheries&apos; sustainability should be achieved by considering biological, social and economic aspects. To this end, different strategies should be followed, including co-management, which encourages scientists, governments, fishers and civil society to jointly manage the ocean resources. Since 2014, several co-management strategies have been implemented in Catalonia, a region with about 580 km of coast in the NW Mediterranean Sea. With the aim to transfer scientific knowledge to better manage the ecosystem, we present here the end-to-end (E2E) system from ICATMAR, the Catalan Institute of Research for the Governance of the Seas. The E2E system includes data collection, processing, analysis, publication and web visualization of bottom trawling and purse seine fisheries sampling data along the Catalan coast. In 2023, all these fisheries represented 85% of the total catch and 77% of the total fisheries revenue of the region.

During 5 years of data collection (2019-2023), the sampling program created a dataset of over 1,500 onboard samplings and 1 million sampled specimens of more than 470 different species. As the combination of environmental data with fisheries monitoring brings new approaches to assess the status of the ecosystem, the collected fisheries data, jointly with the daily fishing landings and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), are all visualized in combination with georeferenced sea habitats (EMODnet), and climate and sea conditions (CMEMS) on the web browser. An open website (www.icatmar.cat) offers the following data visualizations: geolocalized fisheries samplings together with the mentioned data sources, biomass distribution per port or season, and length-frequency charts per species (https://icatmar.github.io/VISAP). To better implement fisheries management strategies, these E2E information systems may be used as a tool to access high-quality open data, facilitate their comprehension and ease the dialogue between science, fisheries, policymakers and civil society.</abstract>

                <abstract>The modern Python geospatial stack encompasses several tools and libraries that allow scientists and developers to write more efficient and scalable data science workflows, from data access and preparation, to analysis and visualization. It provides a great ecosystem for reading and writing cloud-optimized and chunked data formats, accessing data catalogs, handling labeled N-dimensional arrays, parallel and distributed computing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and interactive computing and plotting.

As data scientists increasingly work in teams and tackle bigger and more complex problems, there is a growing need for collaborative platforms that can support sophisticated workflows and large-scale data processing. However, platforms for effective collaboration still have significant challenges, including deployment, configuration, graceful scaling, and environment and dependency management. Addressing these challenges is not trivial and it often requires some DevOps expertise.

In this talk, we&#8217;ll introduce Nebari, a cloud-based open source data science platform built on top of Kubernetes, Dask and the Jupyter ecosystem. Nebari enables organizations to quickly deploy a collaborative platform on any of the major cloud providers. Once deployed, teams can easily access single-user Jupyter Notebook and VS Code servers from their web browsers and start writing and running reproducible and scalable geospatial data science workflows. Integrated with conda-store and Dask, it provides users not only the possibility to build, share and access conda environments from their servers, but also to launch short-lived clusters to handle their compute-intensive tasks.

We&#8217;ll demonstrate how Nebari can be leveraged to develop compute and data intensive applications in the cloud using packages from the modern Python geospatial stack. By the end, we hope to equip organizations with the tools and knowledge to promote better and more effective collaboration in geospatial data science. Organizations can choose to adopt Nebari as an out-of-the box platform for their teams, or use it as a blueprint for developing a custom platform built on top of open source libraries.</abstract>

                <abstract>MAPi is a web platform for online mapping conceived as a public participation tool for schools and organized civil society. Its main functionalities of visualization, analysis, and collection of spatial data were developed to encourage participatory urban planning, especially focusing students and teachers from basic education.
The Center for Metropolitan Studies (CEM), which is the research center that hosts MAPi&#180;s project, has been responsible for producing and openly sharing databases (cartographic and non-cartographic) since its inception 20 years ago.  More recently, CEM expanded its activities in this technology transfer area to develop interactive web systems, like ReSolution and Schools portals, built from the interaction with the center&apos;s academic research work and agendas. So the idea is to bridge the gap between highly complex research and technology transfer to academic and non-academic society, respecting the principle of open data and software. All data produced and all softwares developed, including its source codes, are available at no cost.
In this context, however, there is a great challenge to make the knowledge produced by the CEM, especially the cartographic databases, continuously accessible to a portion of society that does not master geospatial analysis techniques. Although the ecosystem that provides tools for this type of analysis is increasingly more accessible, including through the web, they are still far from being widely adopted in non-specialized contexts, such as classrooms.
To tackle this challenge, MAPi arises to perform as a tool that can expand the use of spatial data in primary and secondary schools. So it has the twofold challenge of gathering simplicity in its navigation to ensure a friendly experience with complexity of technique specificities of exploring and visualizing spatial data,  especially for the non-specialized public.
Thus, MAPi has, since its first version, native integration with CEM&apos;s spatial data repository, GeoCEM, which is developed based on the GeoNode software, with its metadata stored on Geoserver..
Through Geonode, MAPi queries the layers that are published on GeoServer using the Web Feature Service (WFS). WFS specifies an interface for accessing and manipulating geographic elements using the HTTP protocol. The advantage and reason for choosing this standard is its ability to extract only the desired data at the element and attribute level. In this way, we can build a dynamic platform that creates thematic maps in real-time from the parameters chosen by the user, characterizing it as an interactive mapping platform.
MAPi presents as its main tool for spatial data analysis the interface for creating choropleth thematic maps. This type of map is used in MAPi to represent data collected from geographic units such as census tracts and districts. For this functionality, the platform allows the choice between some color palettes (sequential, divergent, or qualitative), which are associated with the polygons of the geographic units according to the class division (quantile or natural breaks). The selection of multiple spatial data layers that are added as a Vector Tile layer in OpenLayers, makes it possible for the user to analyze and compare different themes or periods simultaneously. To serve non-specialized audiences, we maintain only the most essential tools of thematic mapping so that users can in a few steps build visualizations capable of extracting analyses, maintaining some level of parameterization to adapt to the type of phenomenon. Thus, through the OpenLayers and WFS resources, we make parameterizable for each layer its visibility, the attribute that will be associated with the fill color, the data classification method, the color palette, and the attributes that will be displayed in the dynamic map legend (based on attribute values).
Finally, the third axis of functionality, collaborative mapping, aims to provide, in a simplified way, tools for the production of spatial data. We understand here that this functionality can be a tool that enables the expansion and updating of data coverage that official agencies are unable to perform. In this way, we intend to create an area within the platform that allows the creation of forms with location fields to create spatial data to be viewed and analyzed together with the other data on the platform. Currently, only the integration with Mapillary partially accomplishes this goal through the consumption of the visualization of the cover layer, and visualization of the photo sequences available in Mapillary by its users.
One potential application in education from collaborative mapping functionalities is the support in the discussion about neighborhood plans, that are  instruments foreseen under master plan development, like the example from the megacity of S&#227;o Paulo. The tool is under test with basic education teachers that want to promote mapping activities with MAPi in urban geography classes, and also within mathematics classes where they can address methodological issues of the results of this mapping to support basic concepts related to statistics in the classroom. Our next challenges are the optimization of performance for large volumes of data and the implementation of more complex collaborative mapping functionalities in a Agile methodology, with constant interaction with teachers that envision MAPi&#180;s potential to foster engagement of students in urban planning.</abstract>

                <abstract>The purpose of this talk is to clarify the trends, challenges, and opportunities that exist in the geo-data analytics and technology industry. With a focus on the critical importance of data visualization, we will examine the cutting edge tools and approaches that are driving this field ahead, especially those found in the open-source ecosystem.The combination of inovation and technology with geo-data is creating a paradigm-shifting environment in the realm of geospatial analytics.

Unprecedented progress is being made in geo-data, the foundation of spatial analysis, by incorporating advanced analytics. The present developments highlight the mutually beneficial interaction between geo-data and technology innovation, which promotes improved strategic planning and decision-making. Even if the problems are difficult, there are chances for creative solutions that make use of all the data that is accessible. With even from a single petal of a flower, we can visualize a vast data with proper analysis and with geo-data and we can carry out all sort of visualization interms of map with multi purpose graphs and charts.

The talk will explore the vast array of free and open-source resources that enable participants to turn unprocessed data into visually engaging stories. Through the utilization of platforms like QGIS, Openlayers, Maplibre, and D3.js, we can effectively transform intricate geographical data into easily understood and useful insights. These visualizations provide important interpretive value to data and clarify spatial relationships, facilitating well-informed decision-making in a variety of industries.
This talk will also highlight the ground-breaking potential of geo-data analytics to transform sectors and improve societal results. We will illustrate how geo-data analytics may promote innovation, efficient resource allocation, and sustainable development by analyzing case studies and real-world applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk will cover some of the following areas:
1. An overview of Mapillary.
2. Who is contributing and some interesting case studies.
3. Some of the recent updates including 2.0 mobile apps, NeRFs, and improved upload.
4. How to contribute including cameras, upload tools, and best practices.
5. How to download data using Mapillary&apos;s web interface and API.

Since Mapillary launched in 2013, over 2 billion images have been contributed from places as far afield as Antarctica and Zimbabwe. Images can be uploaded from any device that creates geotagged images, from affordable smartphones to commercial grade 360&#176; cameras. 

Every image is processed with computer vision to recreate the world in 3D and extract features that are useful for map making. These capabilities have attracted all sorts of map builders including advocates for pedestrian safety, humanitarian agencies, state and local transportation departments, OpenStreetMap contributors, ridesharing companies and more.

In this talk we&#8217;ll recap Mapillary for those that are less familiar, sharing some more recent case studies to help crystalize the utility of street-level imagery. We&#8217;ll then cover some of the platform changes of 2024, including the launch of the revised mobile apps (2.0). This leads into our latest recommendations for how to capture and upload street-level imagery effectively. We&#8217;ll conclude with a look at how you can download map features using the web interface and Python tools.</abstract>

                <abstract>HOT&apos;s humanitarian program brings together different types of actions that leverage the OpenStreetMap database and its ecosystem of tools to provide local actors, including organizations and governments, with data required in the immediacy of crisis response to natural disasters and other humanitarian situations.  Data creation aims to be timely through a rapid but accurate assessment with local sectors of their most pressing needs for immediate response, intermediate response and then recovery, a phase that can last more than a year after a disaster.  It is a comprehensive process co-designed with local stakeholders and collaborative with all local, regional and global mapping communities interested in this humanitarian issue invited to participate. It includes a certain type of standardized phases, but revisited and prioritized according to needs with high care to people&apos;s vulnerability and to the privacy of certain information. 
This talk will exemplify the support that HOT is giving in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and in particular in the city of Porto Alegre since July 2024. 
In this area of the country, the city government in particular has been helped to have a faster recovery of its educational and health social services, an indirect but concrete way to improve the welfare of the population, with geographic data and open technologies.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of a Human Rights-Based Approach to Data (HRBAD) with open-source geospatial and remote sensing data presents a powerful tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while ensuring no one is left behind. This talk/presentation will explore how HRBAD principles can be applied to open geospatial data, focusing on use cases and applications that enhance our understanding of human rights issues and support evidence-based policy-making.
I will introduce the concept of HRBAD, emphasizing its six key principles: participation, data disaggregation, self-identification, transparency, privacy, and accountability. I&apos;ll then try to demonstrate how these principles align with and can be implemented in open-source geospatial and remote sensing data initiatives.

The presentation will showcase several key use cases and applications:

Participatory Mapping for Inclusive Development: Examples of how platforms like OpenStreetMap enable marginalized communities to contribute to data collection, improving accuracy and empowering advocacy efforts.
Disaggregated Geospatial Analysis for Inequality Assessment: Demonstrating how fine-grained spatial analysis using open satellite imagery can reveal patterns of inequality, supporting the HRBAD principle of data disaggregation.
Transparent Earth Observation for Environmental Justice: exploring the applications of open satellite data for monitoring environmental changes and holding actors accountable for degradation affecting marginalized communities.
Capacity Building through Open Geospatial Education: exploring initiatives that use open data and tools to educate and empower communities in using geospatial technologies for advocacy.

I will discuss how these applications relate to HRBAD principles and consider some of the challenges in using open geospatial data for human rights applications. This includes touching on issues of data quality and accessibility.

The presentation will suggest ways to incorporate HRBAD principles into open geospatial data initiatives, offering practical considerations for data collection, analysis, and dissemination that align with human rights principles.

Through these examples, I hope to illustrate the potential of combining open-source geospatial data with a human rights-based approach, and how this could contribute to more inclusive and effective sustainable development efforts.

This presentation aims to interest professionals from various fields, including geospatial science, human rights, development, policy, and data science. It hopes to encourage further dialogue on the use of open geospatial data in human rights and sustainable development contexts and on applying HRBA to open-source geospatial data.</abstract>

                <abstract>UNICEF is leveraging geospatial technologies in order to geo-enable UNICEF&#8217;s data, systems and processes to transform data into easily accessible, readily available and actionable geospatial information. Such information is essential to address key questions, such as: &#8220;How many children are affected by climate change?&#8221;, &#8220;Where children have limited access to schools AND limited access to health services?&#8221; to support evidence-based advocacy and decision-making for better results for children.
UNICEF has adopted a hybrid geospatial architecture, benefiting from both commercial and open-source GIS solutions. Open-source approach allows us to have more flexibility and enables cost-effective scalability of corporate GIS systems, making them available to all UNICEF users.
GeoSight is an open-source web geospatial data platform developed by UNICEF for easy data visualization and analysis. It is specifically designed to simplify the creation of online maps for visualizing multiple indicators at a subnational level to support evidence-based decision-making. Using GeoSight, UNICEF users and partners can easily overlay multiple indicators representing various thematic areas, such as natural hazards, climate-related risks, but also conflicts, health, education, poverty and other socio-economic indicators.
GeoSight is developed using Django backend and React at a frontend. It has a robust backend interface where users can manage indicator data, basemaps, contextual layers, styles as well as create new projects (dashboards) for publishing data. A dashboard is the main GeoSight product for end-users to interact with the data. It is consists of an interactive map (developed using MapLibre) with multiple indicator layers representing various statistics, typically at national or subnational levels. Indicator layers can be queried and analyzed at different administrative levels (e.g. province or district) at a specific date and time. Additionally, users can cross-query multiple indicators using filters. The map may also contain contextual layers (which can be any point, line, polygon or raster layers) as well as custom basemaps. 
GeoSight has a robust API that allows for system-to-system integrations. This is a powerful feature, which is used for creating automated data pipelines that feed in data from multiple sources and make them available for all users.
GeoSight is a self-service platform that equips UNICEF users at all country offices with an easy to use and powerful geospatial analytical system. The platform has been already used to support UNICEF response in many emergency contexts, including Ukraine and Gaza. It is also used as a dissemination tool for global and regional initiative such as Child Climate Risk Index-Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM), WASH Insecurity Analysis (WIA) and many others.
&#8220;UNICEF has over 70-year history of innovating for children and believes that new approaches, partnerships, and technologies that support the realization of children&#8217;s rights are critical to improving their lives. Early on, UNICEF established guiding principles for innovation and technology in development, which influences the Principles for Digital Development. One of these &#8211; Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation &#8211; explicitly advocates for the licensing of open source software to enable greater impact in international development and cooperation. This Principle has guided UNICEF&#8217;s approach in creating, investing in, and supporting innovations&#8221; (https://www.unicef.org/innovation/dpg-pathfinding-countries). Following this principle, UNICEF has made GeoSight source code publicly available under the terms of an AGPL-3.0 license.
Open source approach is also one of the key elements of the Frontier Data Network - UNICEF&#8217;s strategic initiative designed to promote innovation and capacity building in data science, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly benefit children. Open source solutions are part of how we offer the underlying capabilities that are necessary to actually enable the production and provision of solutions.
We believe that GeoSight can benefit many organizations, both private, NGOs and public, not only in the humanitarian and development sectors. We would like to encourage organizations and individual developers to contribute to GeoSight project and help us and our partners leverage open-source geospatial technology to support the lives of children around the world.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various operational and strategic sectors marks a significant shift in the way data is managed and analyzed. In the geospatial context as in many others, usage of generative AI radically changes the way the user can interact with the platform, bringing new use cases and decoupling the value that we can get out of the data catalogs.

In this presentation, we will quickly cover the generative AI principles (Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, etc&#8230;) and what it can bring to the geospatial ecosystem in terms of usages. 

We will then dive into more specific examples, explain how it works and how we can set them up into existing applications
- Enrich data readability and findability from unstructured data
- Improve search with Semantic or Hybride search
- Bring natural language conversation for easy interactions within the platforms
- Analyze data for a better understanding and outcome

These examples and demonstrations are based on Free and Open Source geospatial solutions and rely on OGC standards. 

Hopefully, the presentation will give your a new perspective about what generative AI can bring to your data and your catalogs, with great insights and concrete applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>The effective management and utilization of water data are critical for both community engagement and scientific analysis. To address the challenges associated with disparate data formats and standards, this presentation explores the use of unifying standards such as WaterML2.0 and OGC API Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR). These standards offer a cohesive approach to data exchange and interoperability, bridging gaps between diverse use cases and technical requirements.

Water data is highly diverse&#8212;spanning vector geospatial features, time series, raster data, and combinations thereof. The Internet of Water (IoW) Coalition advocates for data equity and interoperability, emphasizing the adoption of standardized formats and web services to drive both data science and equitable decision making. Using pygeoapi as a testbed, this session will focus on two primary use cases: community engagement through web applications and modeling &amp; analysis for water resource management.

Use Case 1: Web App Development for Community Engagement and Education
For public-facing applications, ease of use and accessibility are paramount. Here, JSON-based formats like GeoJSON and CoverageJSON are evaluated for their effectiveness in representing water data. The session will demonstrate how CoverageJSON provides a streamlined approach to handling time series and geospatial data, aligning with web development needs and enhancing user engagement through interactive, map-oriented interfaces.

Use Case 2: Scientific Analysis for Water Resource Management
Scientific platforms require comprehensive data exchange and metadata standards to support robust analysis. WaterML2.0, with its detailed metadata and extensive schema, is well-suited for this purpose. However, its XML serialization poses challenges for modern software development workflows and analytical tools. We discuss potential solutions, including a proposed JSON serialization of WaterML2.0 and its integration with OGC API - EDR for data queries and access. 

We will address the trade-offs between these standards, considering factors such as data complexity, metadata requirements, and web compatibility. Recommendations will be made for future development, including enhancements to existing standards and the creation of best practice specifications for effective water data exchange.</abstract>

                <abstract>Since 2013, the Brazilian Army Geographic Service has been committed to migrating its geospatial production into Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). DSGTools, a QGIS plugin released in 2015, is a result of this effort. Currently in version 4.14.0, DSGTools&#8217; features have been used to produce massive amounts of spatial data and have been consolidated as the Brazilian Army&#8217;s official geospatial production suite.

DSGTools offers features such as database creation according to the Brazilian cartographic legislation, layer loading with resolved domains and easy WMS service access from BDGEx, the Brazilian Army Geographic Service SDI. In addition, DSGTools offers a wide range of extraction tools such as the right angle digitalization tool, the free hand digitalization tool, the generic selection tool, the raster selection tool, the feature inspection tool, the DSGTools Processing Algorithm Provider and the Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox (QA Toolbox), which is one of the standout features of DSGTools.

The QA Toolbox runs processes called workflows, which consists of a series of interconnected sequential tasks based on QGIS models executed in a predefined sequence. For each step in this sequence, the QA Toolbox executes a geospatial data processing task, ranging from data cleaning and identification of data inconsistencies.

Moreover, the primary objective of the QA Toolbox is to automate the identification and correction of geospatial data issues introduced during the data extraction process. The execution of a workflow is carried out sequentially, stopping only in specific cases, depending on the configuration chosen by the user. A workflow can have its execution halted when spatial inconsistencies called flags are produced after a model is executed. If a flag is raised during the execution of a workflow, the process halts immediately, prompting users to address the identified issue before proceeding. The QA Toolbox also prevents users from forcing the execution of followup tasks without fixing the flags raised in the current step. By forcing the users to correct the errors pointed out before continuing the process,  the propagation of unhandled inconsistencies is prevented.

The DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox usage can reduce the required time and effort invested on geospatial data production. Users can also create complex workflows that operate independently. The use of a predefined sequence of models ensures that each step in the data processing is performed consistently, following standardized procedures like the Brazilian Standards of Geospatial Data Production set by the National Infrastructure of Spatial Data (INDE). This consistency is crucial for maintaining high-quality geospatial datasets, especially in large-scale projects. The flagging mechanism is a key component of the Brazilian Army Geographic Service&#8217;s production line, ensuring that errors are promptly addressed and preventing the accumulation of issues that could compromise the overall quality of the dataset.

Additionally, the execution status of the DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox can be saved within the user&#8217;s project, allowing the QA process to be carried out over multiple days. Since DSGTools workflows are built using QGIS models, they harness the full power of the QGIS processing toolbox and various plugins, including the 159 processes available in the DSGTools Processing Algorithm Provider.

In this talk, we will showcase all the DSGTools Geospatial Data Quality Assurance Toolbox features and highlight its usage in real-world use cases of geospatial data production. DSGTools is available at the QGIS Plugin Repository, and its code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/dsgoficial/DsgTools.</abstract>

                <abstract>Vector tiles are an efficient way to serve maps with a high volume of live data. IoT applications or maps with weather, traffic or other live data require a compact format for transmitting updated data. Vector tiles with their powerful styling capabilities are supported by several Javascript map viewers.

This talks shows how to disply live data with MapLibre and OpenLayers. On the server side [BBOX](https://www.bbox.earth/) is used to serve tiles from a PostGIS database.</abstract>

                <abstract>PDAL is Point Data Abstraction Library. It is a C/C++ open source library and applications for translating and processing point cloud data. It is not limited to LiDAR data, although the focus and impetus for many of the tools in the library have their origins in LiDAR. PDAL allows you to compose operations on point clouds into pipelines of stages. These pipelines can be written in a declarative JSON syntax or constructed using the available API. This talk will focus on the current state of the PDAL Pointcloud processing library and related projects such as COPC and Entwine, for pointcloud processing. Coverage of the most common filters, readers and writers along with some general introduction on the library, coverage of processing models, language bindings and command line based batch processing. First part will be covering new features for current users. Some discussion of installation method including Docker, binaries from package repositories, and Conda packaging.

                <abstract>The State of California has a recurring issue of devastating wildfires that spread out of control, causing significant damage to the wellbeing of its citizens, its environment and economy.

Due to this recurring issue, the State of California and the USDA&#8212;United States Forest Service committed to applying treatments to one million acres of land (roughly 400,000 hectares), with the goal of reducing the occurrence and severity of these wildfires. Planscape was created as a tool to prioritize and guide this one million-acre effort.

Planscape is a freely available tool built to help landscape planners, public agents and the general public prioritize and learn about landscape interventions that can minimize fire risk and cost while maximizing ecological benefits. 

Planscape uses linear optimization algorithms and over 200 datasets produced by the California Wildfire &amp; Forest Resilience Task Force to determine the priority locations for applying landscape treatments such as mastication, prescribed burns, and others.

This talk aims to outline why and how Planscape is being built by Spatial Informatics Group, with an in-depth description of the technologies in use, software architecture, data handling (pre-processing, usage, post-processing), and an overview of our current goals and challenges.

Ultimately, we will demonstrate how government agencies can leverage Planscape to implement similar optimizations in your community, county, state, or country.</abstract>

                <abstract>18 years ago, OpenLayers was the first alternative to Google Maps, with the ability to display layers from open data sources. Today, Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS and MapLibre can do the same. OpenLayers has found its niche as a full-featured, flexible, and high-performance geospatial JavaScript library that users can count on for the long haul, especially when their mapping needs get more complex.

This talk will provide you with a tour of the latest features in the library, including daring live demonstrations. We will present our recent and ongoing work on adding new features and making the library more fun to work with.

Whether you&apos;re a developer or decision maker, come to this talk to learn about the current status of OpenLayers. We&#8217;ll provide you with a glimpse into the future of the library and leave you motivated to get mapping with OpenLayers.</abstract>

                <abstract>Introduction:

FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) 2024 will be a platform to present innovative and accessible solutions that use free and open-source software for geospatial information management. In this proposal, we highlight the importance of using FOSS to reduce costs, automate processes, and simplify operations in QGIS, with a special focus on applications for large and environmentally sensitive areas such as the Amazon. Our presentation will detail the implementation of the GeoRond&#244;nia project and the use of the GeoINCRA plugin in QGIS, emphasizing its benefits in land regularization and environmental sustainability.

GeoRond&#244;nia Project - Land Regularization and Environmental Sustainability:

The GeoRond&#244;nia project is a partnership between the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Rond&#244;nia (IFRO) and the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), through the Decentralized Execution Term (TED) No. 20/2021/DF/SEDE/INCRA-IFRO. With a duration of 48 months, the project aims to title rural properties in 120 Settlement Projects (PAs), covering a perimeter of 31,000 km and benefiting more than 20,000 families in 26 municipalities. The actions include georeferencing, perimeter demarcation, parceling, occupational supervision, and the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR). With an investment of approximately 23 million reais, GeoRond&#244;nia has already benefited about 15,000 families, standing out as a model of efficiency and economy.

Importance of FOSS in Geospatial Projects:

Rond&#244;nia has 222 Settlement Projects, with approximately 66,000 rural properties, and a large part is being served by the GeoRond&#244;nia project. However, the biggest obstacle is data processing, which involves large volumes and complexity. Therefore, the project sought ways to optimize processes and speed up the achievement of goals within established deadlines, finding in QGIS+GeoINCRA the tools needed for this objective.
Adopting free and open-source software (FOSS) is essential to reduce costs and increase the accessibility of geospatial technologies. Software like QGIS offers a robust and flexible platform for implementing georeferencing and land registration projects, eliminating the need for expensive licenses and allowing the customization of tools according to the specific needs of the projects. With the savings generated in the GeoRond&#244;nia project using QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin, it was possible to direct resources and optimize other processes in the project. Additionally, the solution created using these applications can be replicated to all Brazilian states.

GeoINCRA Plugin: Simplifying Georeferencing in QGIS:

The GeoINCRA plugin was developed to optimize the georeferencing process of rural properties according to INCRA&apos;s technical standards. Implemented in Python, the plugin integrates with QGIS&apos;s processing framework, offering functionalities that automate data querying, attribute filling, and document generation required for land certification. The main tools of the plugin include:
Load Vertex Layer - Loads selected features from a point layer into the vertices layer of the GeoINCRA database; Download ODS Spreadsheet from SIGEF - Generates an empty ODS spreadsheet for later filling; Query INCRA Database - Connects to INCRA&apos;s database to query land assets and generate vector layers; CSV from INCRA to PointZ Layer - Transforms CSV vertex files from INCRA into PointZ layers; GeoINCRA to TopoGeo - Copies features from the GeoINCRA database layers to the TopoGeo database, facilitating the generation of descriptive memorials and topographic maps; Generate TXT for ODS Spreadsheet - Creates a text file with data needed to fill the SIGEF ODS spreadsheet; Fill Vertex Code - Automatically fills the vertex code attribute in the GeoINCRA database&apos;s vertex layer, easing the work of the georeferencing professional.

Methodology and Results:

The adopted methodology includes the modeling of geospatial data in a Geopackage database, the implementation of a plugin in QGIS, and the integration of these elements to optimize the georeferencing workflow. The GeoINCRA database was designed to store topographic data in a standardized and integrated manner, while the GeoINCRA plugin automates processes that traditionally would be manual and prone to errors.
The results achieved with the use of QGIS+GeoINCRA are: Automation of ODS spreadsheets that were previously done manually; Reduction of the time to prepare the spreadsheets by 80%, as the spreadsheets are generated in bulk, i.e., hundreds of plots can be generated at once; Elimination of topological errors that were only seen when trying to insert the data into SIGEF (INCRA&apos;s georeferencing platform); Elimination of errors in textual attributes (spelling errors); Savings for the project, without the need to purchase licenses.
The results obtained demonstrate that the combined use of the GeoINCRA database and the GeoINCRA plugin results in greater productivity, better data standardization, and elimination of software license costs. This approach facilitates access for small companies and professionals to the georeferencing market, aligning with federal government policies on the use of FOSS and promoting independence and public resource savings.

Who Benefits from the GeoINCRA+QGIS Solution:

The presentation at FOSS4G 2024 will highlight how the use of FOSS, exemplified by QGIS and the GeoINCRA plugin, can transform georeferencing projects for a diverse range of stakeholders. This includes government agencies, environmental organizations, and small surveying companies, particularly in vast and environmentally critical areas like the Amazon. By reducing costs, automating processes, and ensuring high-quality results, these solutions significantly contribute to land regularization, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic development in the region. This approach ensures that even resource-constrained entities can efficiently manage geospatial data and meet regulatory requirements.</abstract>

                <abstract>Most of today&apos;s web maps are using the [Web Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection). A major issue of Web Mercator is the distortion of area sizes far from the equator.

In 2018 Bojan &#352;avri&#269;, Tom Patterson and Bernhard Jenny published their work on the [Equal Earth map projection](https://www.equal-earth.com/), an equal-area projection for world maps.

This talk shows how to use the Equal Earth map projection for web mapping with different kind of data sources.

A growing collection of information about using Equal Earth is available at [equal.bbox.earth](https://equal.bbox.earth/).</abstract>

                <abstract>fAIr is an open AI-assisted mapping service developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) that aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mapping efforts for humanitarian purposes. The service uses AI models, specifically computer vision techniques, to detect objects such as buildings, roads, waterways, and trees from satellite and UAV imagery. However currently focused on buildings only . 

The name fAIr is derived from the following terms:

    f: for freedom and free and open-source software
    AI: for Artificial Intelligence
    r: for resilience and our responsibility for our communities and the role we play within humanitarian mapping

In this talk we will talk about the recent developments in fAIr , Our experiment with Yolo model and RAMP model for community mapping and couple of test results . fAIr recently made public version deployment : https://fair.hotosm.org/</abstract>

                <abstract>The proposal consists of the presentation of the benefits that can be obtained by the implementation of a Topology for Spatial Distribution Networks. The concepts of Topology, the steps necessary for its implementation and the benefits for an organization are presented. Finally, the project is presented where, from a Plugin developed in Python in QGIS, the implemented resources and the results obtained are demonstrated. The full content of the Project can be viewed in these two articles:

&#8226;	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topologia-de-rede-espacializada-rodrigo-paschoal-do-valle-wx7hf/?trackingId=gNxyrwDYR1ahkTMHJEN%2FzA%3D%3D

&#8226;	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topologia-rede-de-saneamento-rodrigo-paschoal-do-valle-uxblf/?trackingId=1UOrKCOaQcmffR9BqAnqcQ%3D%3D

Initially, the concepts and steps necessary for the elaboration of Topology will be presented in a simple and objective way. A Water Distribution Network (Sanitation) will be used as an example, as its elements are easy to see. Three main elements will be addressed:

&#8226;	Segments: representing the distribution network.
&#8226;	Valves: representing the point at which the flow can be interrupted.
&#8226;	Reservoir: representing the starting point of the network (start of supply).

For each element, its characteristics (SYNTAX) and behaviors (SEMANTICS) will be presented. The analysis focuses on simplifying the model, meeting what is necessary for the development of the resources that will be explored in Topology.

After the contextualization of the Topology, some challenges faced during its implementation will be presented. Emphasizing the eventual necessary adjustment in the registered elements, as examples:

&#8226;	Unconnected segments: adequacy of the initial and final vertices to establish the connection.
&#8226;	Valves superimposed on segments: division of the segment and insertion of valve between them.
&#8226;	Unconnected reservoirs: adequacy of the segment vertex to establish the connection.

The benefits obtained and the ability to increase the maturity of an organization are addressed, as static records are transformed into active elements, enabling maneuvers, validations and behavior analysis. Thus, we have the development of Network Intelligence. These and other benefits will be addressed in preparation for the presentation of the results developed in the Project.

The project had two stages: In the first, a Natural Gas Distribution Network was used on which the Network Isolation mechanism was implemented; in the second, a Water Distribution Network was used and new resources were implemented: Network Analysis, Network Status and Opening and Closing of Valves. The presentation will focus on the advantages obtained by the implemented resources, demonstrating the characteristics and applications of each one.

For the presentation of the implemented resources, images and videos will be used, as well as made in the published articles.

&lt;u&gt;Step 1: Contextualization of the Gas Distribution case&lt;/u&gt;
&#8226;	&lt;b&gt;Network Isolation:&lt;/b&gt; need to isolate the section in an Emergency situation (Leak)
Presentation of the results and concepts involved: Selected Segment, Isolated Section, Affected Section and Valves to be closed.

Emphasis also on future benefits related to isolation:
&#8226;	Identification of Customers Affected in the maneuvers performed.
&#8226;	Identification of Critical Regions in which a one-off isolation affects a vast region.
&#8226;	Analysis of existing resources in a Graph structure: (1) identification of critical paths, (2) analysis of points without supply redundancy, (3) automatic assignment of the status of segments from the manipulation of valves.
&#8226;	Assistance in Supply Continuity Strategies, identifying Critical Customers (such as Hospitals) that are in vulnerable regions.

&lt;u&gt;Step 2: Contextualization of the Sanitation case and implemented resources&lt;/u&gt;
&#8226;	&lt;b&gt;Network Analysis: &lt;/b&gt;an analysis is made on the imported elements to identify inconsistencies, thus validating the model. The following situations were analyzed: (1) Valves connected to only one Segment, (2) Valves connected to more than two Segments, (3) Segments isolated from the Network, (4) Segments not connected to Reservoirs, and (5) Isolated Valves and Reservoirs. This analysis can be expanded, according to the elements and rules used by Topology, and can also help in estimating the effort required in adjusting records.

&#8226;	&lt;b&gt;Network Status: &lt;/b&gt;from the connections between Reservoirs, Segments and Registers (open and closed) the points of the Network that are Supplied and Not Supplied are presented. With this functionality, the status of a certain stretch is automatically defined, thus not requiring the intervention of an operator to update the Network. The feature has the same behavior for Gas Networks, respecting the elements of Topology.

&#8226;	&lt;b&gt;Opening and Closing of Valves: &lt;/b&gt;after analyzing the Network, it is possible to select the Valves and open/close them, automatically updating the network. This feature is especially important for situations where we need to analyze the impact on the Network of maneuvers performed. This feature can be used in conjunction with Network Isolation to study the behavior of the distribution fabric.

&lt;b&gt;Next steps&lt;/b&gt;
&#8226;	Include the list of Affected Customers in the resources already developed.
&#8226;	Explore opportunities for new resources, some with room to be used by any Distribution Network, others that make sense only for certain contexts;
&#8226;	Use of the model (BDGD) &#8211; Geographic Database of the Distributor, required by ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency) for the delivery of data from the concessionaires, including an Electric Energy Distribution Network to the project;
&#8226;	Prospect any use case related to Telecommunications Networks.

&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;
In this second example, the Water Distribution Concessionaire urgently needed to resupply Hospitals in a certain region of Porto Alegre. As alternatives were implemented, a number of houses and buildings also had their supply normalized. In this situation, only critical points should be supplied, directing the scarce resource only to emergency points. Network Topology enables this maneuver and the creation of strategies for network segmentation.</abstract>

                <abstract>In an era where geographic data underpins critical decision-making across various sectors, the need for open, interoperable data systems has never been greater. This presentation explores the transformative potential of open data through the lens of Overture Maps Foundation. 

Overture Maps Foundation, established under The Linux Foundation in 2022, is developing enterprise grade, open map data as a shared resource. This fast-growing open data community enables companies, government agencies, and other entities to collaboratively build and maintain high-quality foundational map data in a more efficient and cost-effective way. With these base data available for use under open licensing, organizations can then focus on building their business-specific services and applications. Overture Maps&apos; datasets act like a shared freeway, enabling innovation across sectors like local search, logistics, disaster recovery, environmental analysis, augmented reality, and automotive.

This initiative emphasizes interoperability, ensuring that data can be seamlessly integrated and utilized across different platforms and applications. Both interoperability and conflation are vital in collaborative environments where multiple organizations contribute data to ensure that data can be shared and accessed effectively as a unified resource. By leveraging open data and technologies, Overture Maps enables developers, researchers, and policymakers to build advanced geospatial solutions without the constraints of proprietary data silos. 

Join this discussion to learn about:

- Overture and its genesis. Mapping the entire world &#8212; with every community, street, building, home and attractions (even as they change) &#8212; is challenging for any single organization to tackle, and the cost to build and sustain that data continues to grow as the demand for better data increases. 

- Overture&#8217;s project scope. Overture is collaboratively building six global, open foundational data layers that can link to a near-infinite catalog of spatial data through a stable ID system. 

- Overture&#8217;s Global Entity Reference System (GERS). Data conflation and enabling data interoperability are the biggest obstacles in realizing the full value of the abundant open map data resources available today. Conflation in particular is a challenge given spatial and attribute ambiguities and discrepancies across datasets. With GERS, datasets built by different organizations can reference the same real-world map features in a simple, unambiguous way. 

This session will delve into the foundation&apos;s core principles, including the use of open-source tools, community-driven data contributions, and the implementation of best practices for data quality and governance. Attendees will gain insights into the technical architecture of Overture Maps, including its approach to data interoperability, and learn how to contribute to and benefit from this growing ecosystem. Come join us and learn about creating and using a single, coordinated, base map for the world!</abstract>

                <abstract>Over the past 30 years, Argentina has experienced changes in its agricultural and urban development model that have drastically altered land use practices and patterns. (Palmisano, 2018; Pintos and Narodowski, 2012)

These changes have been associated with flooding in several regions (Pal et al., 2021; Pattison and Lane, 2012). In particular, the Lujan River basin has historically experienced extreme events.

In the global scale, prevails the expansion of capitalism by a process of accumulation by dispossession,  characterized by land privatization, expulsion of farmers, conversion or suppression of rights to the commons (Harvey, 2004).

The analysis of these changes in landuse requires information typically obtained from remote sensing, that is validated and complemented with sampling programs. The development of an updated landuse map is a basic tool to study territorial phenomena such as flooding events or land use change. Such a methodology would allow the information to be compared with previously collected data at different scales and time periods.

But geographic information, its format, or processing tools do not generally allow for its reuse or improvement, and are not necessarily openly/freely available. This type of data can be considered a digital commons and can be the subject of mercantilization processes. In fact, publicly produced information and processing tools should be publicly available to enforce knowledge construction. (Arsanjani, 2015; Duf&#233;al and Noucher 2017).

OpenStreetMap is the main framework for volunteered geographic information, and because it constitutes a standardized database, it also allows to be a preferred repository for contributions originating from research programs of universities and public organizations.. Recently has been registered as a public good by an agency affiliated to the United Nations (https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2024/02/05/osm-named-as-a-digital-public-good-by-un-affiliated-agency/)

Data contributed to OSM has already been used to create and validate land use and land cover maps in various regions (Arsanjani et al., 2013; Shultz et al., 2017).

In Argentina,  the local community of OSM users has added a significant amount of geographic information that could be used for land use analysis, which could be further expanded, especially in non-urban areas.
Since 2016, land use data in the middle basin of the Lujan river have been added to OSM as part of projects conducted by the National University of Lujan. Land use was visually assessed using satellite imagery and representative polygons were added with appropriate tags. Geometries were added preferably as multipolygons. Boundaries were drawn to avoid sharing nodes with the road and rail network.

The aim of this work is to present the development of an R package for the analysis of landuse data contributed to OSM. Subsequently, the goal is to increase the contribution of publicly generated information and its analysis tools in an open access format, such as those provided by OSM and R (R Core Team, 2023).

The package can be installed from its github repository https://github.com/aduhour/osmlanduseR.

The package is in an early stage of development and the features included are aimed at 1) download a set of land use related data from OSM using the overpass API. 2) Remove overlaps and measure polygon area. 3) Classify polygons by mapping OSM tags to user-defined classes that can be assimilated to Corine Land Cover classes or the FAO Land Cover Classification System (Schultz et al., 2017; Volante 2009) 4) Create a land use classification map.

                <abstract>A QGIS plugin repository functions as a centralized repository of tools designed to automate and simplify the daily tasks of GIS users. It serves as a hub where company employees and collaborators can access, share, and utilize these tools. This initiative has the additional benefit of enhancing productivity while also cultivating a culture of collaboration and innovation within the organization. In any organization that places a significant reliance on GIS, the efficiency and accuracy of geospatial data processing are of paramount importance. Geographic information system (GIS) teams encounter a number of challenges, including the necessity to perform repetitive tasks, to complete time-consuming data processing steps, and to develop custom tools that are not readily available in standard GIS software. These issues underscored the necessity for a solution that could automate repetitive tasks, provide custom tools tailored to specific needs, and facilitate easy sharing and collaboration among team members. As an open-source GIS platform, QGIS offers a robust plugin architecture that allows users to extend its functionality. 
To develop QGIS plugins, a development environment was established, comprising Python (the primary language for QGIS plugin development), QGIS itself, and the requisite libraries, including PyQt for GUI development, pandas, and requests. A version control system based on the Git distributed revision control system was implemented to facilitate the effective management of the codebase. With the development environment prepared, the coding of the plugins commenced. Each plugin was designed to address a specific task or workflow and they are organized by projects. For example, the data standardization plugin was developed to meet the requirements of Resolu&#231;&#227;o ANM n&#176; 142/2023, the automatic caves CAD file download was created through the use of a database PostGRESQL/PostGIS and an AWS connection, and a Drainage tool was developed to delineate and estimate flow given a pour point of interest and elevation data. The initial step in developing the plugin repository involved understanding the specific needs of the team. A series of meetings and surveys were conducted to gather requirements and identify the most pressing issues. Several team members were involved in the testing process, gathering feedback and making necessary improvements. This iterative process helped refine the plugins and make them robust.
The plugin repository was organized in a manner that was both clear and intuitive. Each plugin was organized in a directory, which contained the source code, documentation, and example datasets. This structure facilitated user navigation of the repository, enabling them to readily identify the tools they required. The Bitbucket platform was selected for hosting the repository due to its widespread use and intuitive interface, which provides a collaborative environment where team members can access the plugins, report issues, suggest enhancements, and contribute to the development process.
To integrate the repository with QGIS, a custom plugin server was incorporated into the QGIS software. The server enabled users to peruse the available plugins, install them with a single click, and receive updates automatically, thus ensuring that users could readily access and utilize the tools without leaving the QGIS environment. To optimize the adoption and efficacy of the plugins, training sessions and workshops were conducted for colleagues. These sessions encompassed the installation and utilization of the plugins, best practices for geospatial data processing, and strategies for integrating the tools into daily workflows.
The QGIS plugin repository has had a profound impact on the organization, delivering key benefits such as increased efficiency, enhanced accuracy, enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing, and enhanced scalability. The automation of repetitive tasks has resulted in a notable reduction in the time and effort required for data processing, thereby enabling team members to direct their attention to tasks of greater critical importance. The implementation of bespoke analytical tools has enhanced the precision and dependability of geospatial analyses. The repository has fostered a collaborative environment in which team members can share their tools and expertise, thereby facilitating continuous improvement and innovation. The modular structure of the repository allows for the straightforward incorporation of new plugins, thereby ensuring that emerging needs and challenges can be addressed.
Considering the repository&apos;s success, several prospective developments have been proposed. These include the expansion of the plugin library through the development of new plugins to address additional tasks and workflows, the incorporation of advanced geospatial analytics such as machine learning and spatial statistics to further enhance capabilities, the linking of the QGIS plugins with other enterprise systems such as databases and web services to create a more integrated and efficient geospatial data infrastructure, and the encouragement of participation from the broader FOSS4G community through the sharing of plugins and contributions to the global repository of geospatial tools and solutions.</abstract>

                <abstract>Visualizing and analyzing large-scale geospatial datasets, such as Overture Maps&apos; comprehensive global dataset containing more than 3 billion features grows more challenging as these datasets continue to expand in size and scale. This presentation introduces Lonboard, a cutting-edge open-source Python library designed to address this challenge by enabling fast, interactive geospatial vector data visualization within Jupyter notebooks.

Lonboard&apos;s exceptional performance and ease of use stem from its innovative architecture, built on four key technologies: deck.gl for GPU-accelerated rendering, GeoArrow for efficient in-memory representation, GeoParquet for optimized file storage, and anywidget for seamless Jupyter integration. This powerful combination allows Lonboard to move data from Python to JavaScript and then to the GPU with unprecedented efficiency.

Unlike existing solutions that rely on slower GeoJSON encoding, Lonboard employs a fully binary pipeline. It leverages GeoPandas as the primary user interface, internally managing conversions to GeoArrow and GeoParquet for efficient data transport and rendering. This approach not only accelerates data processing but also significantly reduces the data size transferred to the browser.

We will demonstrate Lonboard&apos;s capabilities using Overture Maps data, which is provided in GeoParquet format as monthly releases. This showcase will highlight how Lonboard&apos;s simple interface allows researchers and data scientists to effortlessly visualize and interact with cloud-native, optimized geospatial data at a global scale.</abstract>

                <abstract>Every day, almost 2.5 million edits are made in OpenStreetMap. To maintain the high quality and reliability of OSM data, keeping track of changes is crucial. In 2024, a new OSM data pipeline was built for [OSMCha](https://osmcha.org/), one of the main OpenStreetMap data validation tools. This pipeline is fully open-source, and it allows us to visualize and run data quality checks on each edit made on OSM. Besides the set of open-source tools and the Kubernetes deploy infrastructure, the resulting data is available for free under the AWS Open Data program. We&#8217;ll share how this new pipeline streamlines data integrity and enables developers to build downstream cloud-native applications to monitor the changes happening in OpenStreetMap. We will also demo Gradient, a web application that displays OSM edits using this new real-time OSM pipeline.</abstract>

                <abstract>In today&apos;s fast-paced, data-driven environment, organizations that use geospatial data for analysis are challenged by managing complex datasets and frequent updates. Geospatial data provides valuable context and information, enhancing applications in various domains such as logistics, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and marketing.
Traditionally, many organizations have relied on no-code geospatial software with click-based interfaces. Due to their accessibility and user-friendly interface, these tools allow team members to visualize and manipulate geospatial data without the need for programming knowledge. However, as data starts to become more complex, these tools often present scalability limitations, restricting the full potential of geospatial data applications.
This paper explores the benefits of transitioning to a hybrid approach by integrating Python and open-source geospatial libraries into the data processing phase of geospatial analysis. By presenting the possible advantages gained and providing a hands-on example of Python use in geospatial data, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how Python can play a pivotal role in overcoming the limitations of no-code solutions.
Python can enhance the data extraction phase, enabling integration with various data sources and APIs and connecting to external databases and web services. This capability supports consistent data exchange and real-time data integration. This phase can also be automated, summarizing all steps into a script that can be applied to every new dataset.
The processed data can be visualized using various libraries in a Python environment or used as input for traditional geospatial software. The hybrid approach leverages the user-friendly visualization tools of no-code software while enabling more sophisticated data processing capabilities.
The output data can also be used as input for developing custom algorithms, including the integration of machine learning models and artificial intelligence. This step enables a wide range of applications, such as urban feature prediction, classification or segmentation of remote sensing data, and clustering of spatial data.
Adopting a hybrid approach significantly enhances an organization&apos;s analytical capabilities. These advanced analyses provide deeper insights into spatial patterns and trends that manual methods alone may not reveal.
The hands-on example, based on census data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), demonstrates geospatial data processing with Python and the GeoPandas library, both open-source solutions. This example will include the use of Python in geospatial data processing through the following steps: data extraction, data processing, and customized algorithm application.
In conclusion, integrating Python into these workflows enhances flexibility and analytical capabilities, allowing organizations to innovate in their solutions and create new opportunities for products and services. Coding elevates data-driven decision-making and enables more sophisticated and scalable analyses, particularly when dealing with large and complex datasets. This case study serves as an inspiring example for organizations and researchers aiming to maximize the potential of their geospatial data, highlighting the significant benefits of combining traditional geospatial software with powerful open-source tools.

                <abstract>Join us for an insightful exploration of the Tethys Platform, a feature-rich tool for developing and deploying web applications for the Earth sciences. Tethys Platform addresses technical barriers by offering a curated suite of free and open-source software (FOSS) accessible through the Tethys SDK - developers can access powerful tools like OpenLayers, CesiumJS, Bokeh, and Plotly for visualization, and GeoServer, THREDDS, and PostGIS for hosting geospatial and gridded datasets. We will explore the versatility of open-source web GIS and how Tethys Platform enables effective communication of scientific information to enhance the decision-making processes. In collaboration with leading regional organizations worldwide, we will showcase several Tethys portals and web applications that utilize satellite data and geospatial technologies effectively for managing water resources, climate risks, and land use. Further, Tethys promotes interoperability and collaborative decision making while meeting diverse organizational requirements. Our talk aims to provide a holistic understanding of how Tethys Platform uses open-source GIS and web applications to significantly augment decision-making capabilities, stimulate innovation, improve data interoperability, and foster collaboration among GIS professionals, researchers, and policymakers. Additionally, we will discuss the challenges of portability of web applications between different organizations&apos; web servers - government organizations often require hosting and managing web applications on their own servers due to political, branding, and security motivations, rather than relying on third-party websites. Our approach ensures that organizations can leverage advanced environmental analysis tools while maintaining sovereignty over their web applications&apos; deployment and management. Tethys Platform&#8217;s many capabilities have garnered significant international interest, evidenced by diverse applications developed by users worldwide.</abstract>

                <abstract>PLATEAU is a digital twin initiative led by Japan&apos;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) that collaborates with various stakeholders to develop, utilize, and open &#8220;3D city models&#8221; across the country. Launched in fiscal 2020, this digital twin data of cities was created for around 200 cities across Japan by fiscal 2023 and continues to expand coverage. We have developed over 100 use cases in various areas, such as urban planning, disaster prevention, and environmental management. PLATEAU has been working to develop an ecosystem to promote open innovation in urban areas. The datasets are openly available in various formats. In addition, we release a wide range of knowledge, including guides, technical material, and source code for our website.</abstract>

                <abstract>The purpose of this work is to show the benefits and difficulties of using scripts, whether in Python or SQL.
The work is the result of the author&apos;s experience in developing sophisticated Python scripts to build a thematic model for the heat spot data from the &#8220;BD Queimada program&#8221; of Brazil&apos;s National Institute for Space Research.
The thematic model consists of generating tables in the database (Postgres) that represent the themes with the heat spot data. The themes are represented by area of interest, such as Conservation Units, Indigenous Lands, Settlements, Biomes, ...
The aim of the work was to import the heat spot data and generate aggregated tables with themes in an automated way, making it easy to add new themes.
After the script went into production, it was necessary to add another theme, and although I made an effort in the script to make it easy to add a new theme, things didn&apos;t work out the way I wanted them to.
By writing the script in SQL, and putting it into production, the author can observe the details of when we should use Python or SQL to automate the thematic model with hotspots.
The script is being used to help monitor forest fires in the main areas of operation of The National Center to Prevent and Combat Forest fires.</abstract>

                <abstract>Open-source software has become increasingly crucial for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and its Members, particularly those in developing countries, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  The potential of open source can enable climate action for adaptation, while also addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the current landscape of open-source development within the WMO.

Open-source solutions also play a pivotal role as accelerators for the implementation of Early Warnings for All, a key UN initiative in which WMO is playing a critical role, aimed at protecting every person on Earth with life-saving early warning systems by 2027. By providing accessible, customizable, and cost-effective tools, open-source software enables WMO Members to rapidly deploy and adapt early warning systems to their specific needs and contexts. This approach is particularly crucial for developing countries, LDCs and SIDS, where resource constraints often hinder the implementation of proprietary solutions.

Moreover, open-source initiatives serve as powerful catalysts in supporting WMO Members&apos; efforts towards digital transformation. As National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) worldwide strive to modernize their operations and services, open-source tools offer a flexible and scalable foundation for innovation. They enable Members to leverage cutting-edge technologies, collaborate on development, and share best practices, thus accelerating their digital transformation journeys while optimizing resource utilization.

For many years, WMO has been actively involved in developing and supporting open-source software as a low-barrier, low-cost solution for its Members. These efforts, combined with comprehensive training and mentoring activities, have been met with enthusiasm and success.

This presentation will provide an overview of Open Source at WMO, its significant use, current status and future plans for increased development and use of Open Source software to help lower the implementation barrier to data exchange of weather/climate/water/environmental data.

Join us as we explore how WMO is transforming global weather, water, and climate data sharing, and discover how this initiative, along with FOSS4G tools, is fostering collaboration, innovation, and societal benefits on a global scale, with a particular focus on supporting Climate Action and Early Warning for All.</abstract>

                <abstract>Ever since the year 25,000 B.C.E, when the first known map was carved into a Mammoth tusk, map makers have relied on geometric symbols derived from nature in order to represent a geography. However, even though modern digital cartography brings about endless possibilities for map customization and visualization, the art of utilizing geometric symbols in maps has been all but forgotten in the era of modern map design.

In order to resurrect, appreciate, and preserve the art form of geometric patterns derived from nature, and to incorporate them in a nuanced form within modern digital cartography, we present Mapajoara: a self-contained free and open source interactive map of Bel&#233;m integrating indigenous Marajoara iconography into the underlying map interface, using ancient drawing patterns to represent different geographic and urban elements.

Each Marajoara pattern appearing on the map has been studied and carefully selected to symbolize rivers, forests, urbanized areas, and other significant aspects of Bel&#233;m, offering a visually distinct and culturally enriching experience to users. Our project not only highlights the beauty and importance of Marajoara art, but also promotes interaction and learning about the geography and culture of the region through a modern and accessible technological platform.</abstract>

                <abstract>pygeometa provides a lightweight and Pythonic approach for users to easily create geospatial metadata in standards-based formats using simple configuration files (affectionately called metadata control files [MCF]). Leveraging the simple but powerful YAML format, pygeometa can generate metadata in numerous standards. Users can also create their own custom metadata formats which can be plugged into pygeometa for custom metadata format output.

For developers, pygeometa provides a Pythonic API that allows developers to tightly couple metadata generation within their systems and integrate nicely into metadata production pipelines.

The project supports various metadata formats out of the box including ISO 19115, the WMO Core Metadata Profile, and the WIGOS Metadata Standard.

pygeometa has minimal dependencies (install is less than 50 kB), and provides a flexible extension mechanism leveraging the Jinja2 templating system.

This presentation will provide an update on recent enhancements, use in high profile projects as well as future plans and roadmap.</abstract>

                <abstract>Tiled maps are well-known for their performance and have been present in web map applications for more than twenty years. Vector tiles combine all the benefits of map tiling with the ability to access attributes, enabling client side attribute-based rendering. This makes them one of the most efficient ways of visualising vector data, and they are present in many interactive web maps that we see on the web today.

However the proliferation of web map applications has often resulted in a lack of interoperability between tile servers and clients. This was the motivation for the OGC API - Tiles Standard (https://tiles.developer.ogc.org/), published in late 2022. The core of this Standard is very simple, adding some formality to what people have been doing for years with XYZ tilesets, while specifying some metadata elements that help clients do a better job at creating maps (e.g.: title, description, zoom levels, custom projection). 

In this talk we will present a software stack to render OGC compliant vector tiles. This stack includes pygeoapi (https://pygeoapi.io/), an OSGeo project and a Reference Implementation for OGC API - Tiles (https://www.ogc.org/resources/product-details/?pid=1663). The architecture of pygeoapi supports backend plugins, which use different software for storing and accessing geospatial data. For the purpose of creating vector tiles, we will present the MVT-elastic plugin (https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/blob/master/pygeoapi/provider/mvt_elastic.py), which leverages the Elasticsearch capability of rendering vector tiles on the fly, from geospatial data stored in an Elasticsearch index. Elasticsearch (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Recently, this plugin also became capable of exposing the attributes associated with the data, enabling client side styling of attributes. These capabilities can be demonstrated by creating a Leaflet map that consumes and styles the pygeoapi+elastic vector tiles (https://emotional-cities.github.io/vtiles-example/demo-oat.htm). 

We hope that this presentation can make the creation of fast, expressive and interoperable maps, accessible to anyone.</abstract>

                <abstract>The current state of the art of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) is limited to solutions that are already becoming stagnant in terms of their approach and technology.

Today, we need more robust and modern SDIs, beyond the logic of flat data tables with a spatial component, with data access that is either all open or all closed, lacking granularity.
Wagtail is originally used as a content management system, I propose a modern SDI where data management can be granular, with access roles and version control.

Thanks to the pygeoapi library, this application also allows the publication of modern REST web services, according to OGC API specifications.

The premise of this proposal is to have a platform with extensive features, but also with current and modern standards, and as simple as possible, without the need to integrate multiple platforms and synchronization agents, etc.

Basically, this is a simple Django, but enhanced for the management and publication of spatial data with a modern and scalable approach.

Wagtail is well known for content management but its use for spatial data management has not been explored until now. On the other hand, pygeoapi is an agnostic library but primarily intended only for publication, not for data management, even less for data that changes day by day.

For ending this proposal precisely resolves both the granular and versioned management of spatial data as well as their publication according to the new OGC (OGC API) standards.</abstract>

                <title>Leveraging Geospatial Street Data for Effective Urban Mobility Policies: A Comprehensive Methodology for Road Safety Analysis in Brazilian Cities Through Geoprocessing</title>
                <subtitle></subtitle>

                <abstract>Cities can be characterized as an extremely complex and dynamic environment, which integrates multiple interdependent factors and presents a significant challenge in the development and monitoring of public policies. To deal with this complexity and ensure truly effective policies, data-driven decision-making is essential. Cities produce a large volume of data that is crucial for informing these policies. However, many cities face significant challenges in collecting and analyzing quality data due to a lack of technical and human resources. Furthermore, while tabular data is important, it often fails to capture the complex contextual layers present in the urban territory. Geospatial information provides a deeper and more contextualized understanding of the urban context, enriching the decision-making process and promoting more effective public policies.
Within the complexity of city management, safe and sustainable mobility increasingly stands out as an area demanding special attention, primarily due to the challenge of addressing the issue of premature road traffic deaths and injuries. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that more than 1.19 million people die in traffic worldwide every year &#8212; in Brazil, there are over 30,000 annual victims.
The Safe System and Vision Zero Approach, which advocate that no death or serious injury in traffic is acceptable, illustrate the complexity of urban mobility. The concept involves several areas of action that must be worked on in an integrated manner, including safe road infrastructure and urban design. Therefore, understanding all layers of the territory is essential for identifying risk areas, planning effective interventions, and monitoring results, ensuring that mobility contributes to building a safer urban environment.
The complexity of cities and the need to deeply understand the various aspects that comprise them make territorial analysis an indispensable component in the data and evidence-based decision-making process. By collecting and using data to identify critical areas, for example, it is possible to effectively propose road safety actions and public policies aligned with the Safe Systems approach. For this reason, the Cordial Institute sought to create a methodology for interpreting the territory to facilitate road safety analyses and offer valuable data-based information. This way, it is possible to directly assist municipalities in developing public policies that promote safer mobility in Brazilian cities.
This methodology, named &#8216;Structurals&#8217;, assumes that the road system is not uniform but divided between intersections and mid-blocks (structurals), each having different interactions in the urban environment. Road intersections, for example, are areas of many encounters between different road users, which can sometimes lead to conflicting situations. These conflicts can result in traffic incidents and, therefore, this dynamic deserves significant attention. On the other hand, mid-blocks have different behaviors, such as increased vehicle acceleration or pedestrians crossing outside designated areas, so it is also important in analyses in a complementary way to intersections&#8217;.
The processing of structurals requires a few spatial databases that are commonly developed by municipalities: road blocks, central median/divider (if the road block base does not contain this information), and road axis. With this, it is possible to generate a tool with significant analytical impact using easily processed data from municipalities.
To georeference this dynamic, it is necessary to trace the road axis to identify where they meet (intersections) and where they are continuous (mid-blocks). Using PostGIS, the geospatial data extension of PostgreSQL, both free and open-source, a geospatial processing is performed where perpendicular lines to the roadblock polygons are drawn, meeting at an equivalent geometric distance point. Lines are drawn every meter along the roadblock face, resulting in several points located at the road&apos;s central axis. These points are connected by lines forming the road axes. When they intersect, they are identified as a road intersection.
From the geoprocessing, intersection areas are drawn in an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) program, QGis. These areas are &#8216;buffers&#8217; created from the points generated by the geometric operations, and have their design adapted if they intersect, not being limited only to the geometric point created by the axis crossing &#8212; it is not a simple buffer around each crossing but is dissolved to adapt to the road&apos;s morphology. This process identifies a primary characteristic of the road system intersections that can be included in territorial analyses: the intersection profile, or how many approaches each intersection has, making it more or less complex proportional to the number of approaches.
Once the areas considered intersections are established, the street axes not present in this area are extracted and become mid-blocks. In other words, mid-blocks are defined after the intersections&apos; geometric definition, as their geometric opposite.
From the structurals&apos; design, it is possible to pair with all available geographic territorial information. The more data provided by municipalities, the greater the territory&apos;s knowledge and the possibility of relating these variables. Each structural has characteristics that make more sense to be deepened. In intersections, traffic lights, bus or cycling infrastructure, road hierarchies, and pedestrian crossings can be paired. In mid-blocks, the road width, road hierarchy, speed limit, electronic surveillance presence, speed reducers, block face length, etc., can be paired.
Pairing information with structurals helps identify profiles of these spaces and create insights into road crashes in Brazilian municipalities. With this pairing, it is possible to analyze the distribution of road events between intersections or mid-blocks and their characteristics, the severity of occurrences, and identify critical points that should be prioritized in public policies. Additionally, it is an essential tool for effectiveness analyses and creating comparison groups for monitoring interventions. For example, with intersection structurals, it was possible to identify crossings with similar characteristics in S&#227;o Paulo to evaluate whether those that received the &quot;Frente Segura&quot; intervention had a reduction in traffic incidents. The same was done with the &quot;Melhor Uso do Leito Vi&#225;rio (MULV)&quot; interventions carried out in mid-blocks of the city. These and other uses of the structurals can be seen on the publication page of the Brazilian Mobility Panel, from the Cordial Institute.</abstract>

                <abstract>The Geological Survey of Brazil (SGB) is under a digital transformation process. One of the pillars of this process involves speed, scalability, security and availability of data produced. Furthermore, CPRM is creating a favorable environment for the adoption of cloud-based architecture.

This paper aims to present an overview of a new developed Geological Spatial Data Infrastructure for the SGB. The GeoSGB is the main source for internal mapping, infographic and dashboard applications. It will assimilate legacy services, that runs on isolated map servers, such as self hosted node of OneGeology OGC Services.

The solution adopted is GeoNode 4.2, which brings together map, data services, metadata catalog and spatial database. It is free and open source software with a very active community. In addition, GeoNode has a good content management system, a rich API, and it&#8217;s fully customizable. To meet data access demands, it was customized to run in Kubernetes-based environments and each mapped area produces its own geoservice, exportable to different formats, such as shapefile and geotiff.

However, it became necessary a complete separation between the production and publishing environments. SGB&#8217;s production pipeline is composed by internally developed data management software. Some of these systems are being modernized, with updates on business rules, frameworks and security. GIS work is carried out in ArcGIS Enterprise&#174;, with some exceptions in QGIS and GeoServer. With this background, it should be considered as a hybrid GIS model.

About database structures, a process of harmonization was necessary, mainly those produced from proprietary GIS. For legacy reasons, the proprietary structures were maintained, as long as possible to export to OGC WKT or WKB. Exported geometries are analyzed for compliance with Simple Features Standard (OGC/ISO19125). The information eligible for publication were consolidated in database views and is literally replicated to GeoSGB, by script.


The metadata production for continuous databases is carried out semi-automatically &#8211; templated - in accordance with the mapping program. This is possible by integrating GeoNode&apos;s APIs with internal databases, delivering associated metadata and resources directly to the authors. The contact with (meta)data authors were managed by GeoNode.

The symbolization of thematic layers involved the development of interoperable libraries, based on SVG glyphs inserted in OpenType fonts (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007), with near equal rendering among different multi-platform GIS software.

Data and metadata pipelines were implemented using Python scripts, with specific libraries associated with GeoNode APIs. Apache Airflow manages the entire process of extracting internal bases, quality tests, structure analysis and loading on the GeoSGB database server, including being responsible for notification activities.

So, GeoSGB now is a continuous development platform, with focus in increase quality in delivered data to customers.

The future perspectives involve the transformation itself into research line in geotechnologies and high-performance IT services. It shoud envolve plug-in development for data management, processing and visualization including use of artificial intelligence. In operational terms, adoption of OGC APIs, data internationalization and harmonization, associated with adoption of OGC specific standards, such as GeoSciML and WaterML contributes to become SGB a global supplier of geoscientific data.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk presents case studies of deploying GeoNode, an open-source geospatial content management system, in production environments within two Brazilian government agencies: the Geological Survey of Brazil (SGB) and the Brazilian Federal Police (PF). We&apos;ll explore how these agencies have successfully implemented and customized GeoNode to meet their specific needs, addressing common challenges in large-scale FOSS4G deployments.

Key points we&apos;ll cover:

1. SGB&apos;s approach:
   - Developing a Helm chart for automated GeoNode 4 installation on Red Hat OpenShift
   - Addressing security requirements like rootless execution and random UID support
   - Implementing autoscaling for most components based on CPU and memory utilization
   - Exploring cluster implementation of GeoServer for improved scalability

2. PF&apos;s customizations:
   - Creating a dedicated &quot;inteligeo-deploy&quot; repository for enhanced deployment features
   - Implementing centralized configuration and logging
   - Improving security by separating credentials and using Podman instead of Docker
   - Integrating with internal systems and scheduling data updates

We&apos;ll discuss the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned from both approaches. These case studies demonstrate that FOSS4G solutions like GeoNode are ready for production use in government agencies, providing flexibility, scalability, and security.

By sharing our experiences, we aim to help other organizations successfully deploy GeoNode and other FOSS4G solutions in production environments. We welcome questions and discussions on best practices for large-scale FOSS4G implementations.</abstract>

                <abstract>Extreme precipitation events lead to rapid surface runoff, causing sheet erosion and the formation of rills, increasing the risk of flash floods. This combination of processes pose a threat to agricultural and rural areas and the sediment-laden water can infect even the urban zones or cause damage to infrastructure. Detecting and predicting the formation of erosive rills on agricultural land is, therefore, crucial for effective land management and disaster prevention in rural areas.  

  

The contribution presents a research on the utilisation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect enhanced erosion using remote sensing data combined with the SMODERP hydrological and erosion model.   

  

While most tools for semantic segmentation (such as random forests) work only with single-pixel values, CNNs consider also the relationship with its surroundings and between the bands. As the erosion rill patterns are visible especially when compared to the surrounding soil, it is a valuable feature for their detection.   

  

However, if we also have the digital elevation model, we can use geospatial tools and algorithms to enhance the imagery input to the neural networks with knowledge-based indices. In this case, it is the SMODERP model.  

  

SMODERP is a hydrological model designed to simulate surface runoff and erosion processes. It considers various factors such as soil type, land cover, slope, and rainfall intensity to predict the movement of water and sediments throughout the landscape. The model calculates the critical height of sheet runoff as a rill formation threshold, which is essential to understand where erosion is likely to occur. The SMODERP is developed as a GIS tool, available through GRASS GIS and QGIS. More details about model on smoderp.fsv.cvut.cz or on GitHub.  

  

The methodology begins with data collection and preparation, utilising high-resolution orthophoto aerial images of spatial resolutions of only a few centimetres. Additionally, hydrological data from the SMODERP model are incorporated to the CNN&apos;s input to capture erosion dynamics. The talk will discuss the effect of the SMODERP&apos;s output inclusion on the CNN&apos;s accuracy in rill detection.</abstract>

                <abstract>Open Software and Open Standards are complementary pieces of the geospatial ecosystem. In January 2022, OSGeo and OGC signed a new and updated version of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that aims to maximize the achievement of the mission and goals of both organizations. Execution of joint Code Sprints, identifying free and open source technologies that could be used as Reference Implementations for OGC Standards and validating OGC compliance tests are examples of activities that can take place within the scope of the agreement.

In the first year after the agreement was signed, we established the basilar stones for the OSGeo membership within OGC and promoted the related activities within OSGeo. Now we start to see an increasing interest from both sides and some outcomes which are important to highlight.

This presentation will provide an overview of all activities accomplished under the MoU over the last year, as well as discuss future plans. For those who have been distracted, it will reiterate the benefits of the agreement, which allows OSGeo charter members to represent the priorities of OSGeo in the development of OGC Standards and supporting documents and services.

                <abstract>## Introduction

The ability to efficiently and accurately represent geographic data is a cornerstone of many modern applications, from navigation systems to environmental monitoring. Uber&#8217;s H3 index offers a transformative approach to handling spatial data, making it a valuable tool for developers and researchers alike. In this talk, we will explore how the H3 index can be utilized across a variety of open-source projects. We will delve into its advantages, such as ease of distance calculation, reliability at extreme latitudes, and the benefits of storing data as areas rather than points. Additionally, a live demo will illustrate the practical applications of the H3 index in real-time.

## Main Points

1. **Ease of Distance Calculation**
   
   Calculating distances between geographic points is a fundamental task in many applications. Traditional methods, relying on latitude and longitude, can be computationally intensive and complex. The H3 index simplifies this process by using a hexagonal grid system. Each hexagon, or cell, has a unique identifier that allows for straightforward distance calculations. This system reduces the computational overhead and enhances the performance of applications that require frequent distance measurements, such as ride-sharing services and delivery optimization platforms.

2. **Reliability at the Poles**

   Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) become less reliable and more distorted as one moves towards the poles due to the curvature of the Earth. The H3 index mitigates this issue through its hexagonal grid, which maintains consistent cell shapes and sizes across the globe, including polar regions. This characteristic ensures that spatial analyses and operations are accurate and reliable, regardless of geographic location. For instance, environmental monitoring projects can benefit from this consistency when tracking climate change indicators in polar areas.

3. **Storing Data as Areas**

   Traditional spatial data storage often relies on point-based representations, which can lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with large datasets or areas. The H3 index allows for data to be stored as areas rather than points, leveraging its hexagonal cells. This approach offers several advantages:
   - **Efficiency:** Hexagonal cells cover areas more uniformly, reducing data redundancy and improving storage efficiency.
   - **Accuracy:** By representing regions as collections of hexagonal cells, spatial analyses can be more precise. This is especially useful for applications such as urban planning and resource management.
   - **Scalability:** Hexagonal cells can easily aggregate or disaggregate, facilitating scalable solutions for various spatial resolutions.

## Conclusion

Uber&#8217;s H3 index is a powerful tool that enhances how we handle and analyze geographic data. Its ease of distance calculation, reliability at extreme latitudes, and efficient area-based data storage present significant advantages for a wide range of open-source projects. By adopting the H3 index, developers and researchers can achieve more accurate, efficient, and scalable solutions for their spatial data needs.

During the talk, we will demonstrate these benefits with a live demo, showcasing how the H3 index can be implemented in a real-world scenario. Whether you are a developer seeking to optimize your application&#8217;s performance or a researcher aiming for precise spatial analysis, the H3 index offers a versatile and robust solution.</abstract>

                <title>Enhancing Resilience to Pluvial Flooding in Pacific Island Nations: A Novel Approach to Rapid Rainfall Modelling and Risk Assessment.</title>

                <abstract>Flooding caused by rainfall poses a significant hazard to Pacific Island nations that are at risk of cyclones and large rainfall events. Particularly, island nations such as Samoa, which are characterised by high mountains and steep river gullies, are highly susceptible to flash flooding events. Despite this recognised threat, a notable absence of reliable, high-quality data hinders the application of traditional hydrodynamic models that typically rely on precise river flow values and often disregard rainfall factors. Furthermore, there is an absence of flood hazard inundation maps that can provide a basic indication and outline the potential consequences of rainfall-induced flooding on both the populace and the environment within these regions.

To address these challenges, the Pacific Risk Tools for Resilience Phase-2 (PARTneR-2) project, co-led by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and the Pacific Community (SPC), has introduced a novel approach to rapid rain-on-grid modelling. This methodology uses a combination of open-source geo-spatial software, including QGIS, RAS Mapper, and 2D hydrodynamics software BG-Flood, on limited geo-spatial data to rapidly produce indicative flood depth inundation maps.

Our study has concentrated on two Pacific Island nations: Samoa and Vanuatu. For these two countries, we have developed a series of flood depth inundation maps at national coverage for 10-, 50-, and 100-year Annual Recurrence Intervals (ARI). The model used to produce the maps requires limited input data, is reasonably easy to set up, and can be run in under 12 hours. The maps produced are useful in providing a basic indication of areas that are at the most risk of flooding in a specified rainfall event. The method is cost-effective and can be implemented using entirely open-source software.

Furthermore, by integrating the flood maps produced by this study with geo-spatial asset data sets, particularly focusing on buildings, our study shows how we can quantify the exposure and potential losses to flooding events, employing the Riskscape multi-hazard risk modelling software. The outcomes generated by this innovative method offer valuable insights that can inform resource allocation decisions during the critical hours following a significant rainfall event, particularly in the context of a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) study.</abstract>

                <abstract>INTRODUCTION

The development of Gema (Map Manager) and Sisdai (System of Design and Accessibility for Research) is based on two main premises:

1) The information generated with public money should be public and for free.

2) The Mexican government is moving towards technological autonomy and independence; therefore, free software components should be conceived for development and use in the federal public administration.


INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

Gema and Sisdai have been developed by the Center for Research in Geospatial Information Sciences, A.C. (CentroGeo) and have been coordinated by the National Council of Humanities, Sciences and Technologies (Conahcyt), which is the Mexican government institution responsible for establishing public policies on humanities, sciences, technologies and innovation throughout the country.


ARTICULATION WITH ENI

Conahcyt created the National Informatics Ecosystems (ENI) to make available the results of research funded by the state, publishing open data, information visualizations, analysis and maps that help citizens better understand the country in which they live. 

ENIs are collaborative and open access spaces that contribute to local and regional knowledge to address Mexico&apos;s priority problems by storing, processing, analyzing and disseminating humanistic, scientific and technological information. The topics addressed are: toxic agents and polluting processes, water, culture, education, energy and climate change, health, human security, socio-ecological systems and sustainability, food sovereignty and housing.

Gema and Sisdai are articulated with the ENIs, as contributions to open science. All of them are available in public portals.


GEMA

We will begin this talk by asking: is it possible to have a country where the government, academia, civil society, private sector and media collaborate to generate, publish and consume open data? And the answer is simple: this would be ideal, but today it remains a utopia.

Gema is moving towards institutional interoperability, but also exploring the incorporation of data outside the scope of government. 

Conahcyt manages research projects with academia and we all know that historically scientific production has been shared mainly in specialized journals, books and research articles that generally involve payment.

Additionally, what happens to the data used as input in research? It usually remains within the research teams and is not published, hindering replicability, interoperability and methodological contrast.

This project contributes to open science by promoting free access to scientific research products (data, methodology, code, etc.).

In Mexico there are different national instances of data collection, integration and visualization, for example the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the Ministry of Health, the National Population Council (Conapo), the Executive Secretariat of the National Public Security System, among others.

To support the analysis and visualization of data, Gema has loaded layers of information from all of the above-mentioned agencies, making it possible to cross-reference official data with information derived from research projects. 

Gema (in English Gem) takes its name from the combination of the first letters of the words &#8220;gestor&#8221; and &#8220;mapas&#8221; in Spanish, thus alluding to a precious stone, as well as to the gradual process it takes to become a real precious jewel, such as the constant transformation of data into information and knowledge, which results in an input of great value and importance.  

As a Geospatial Knowledge Infrastructure, created in an open science environment and with accessibility criteria, Gema integrates a free data model, as well as tools so that users can explore, compile, visualize and share geospatial information related to humanistic, scientific and technological activity. 


SISDAI

Beyond being a free software project, it is a design system that allows to establish rules, patterns and practices to ensure the consistency of complex, flexible and constantly evolving digital products. 

Sisdai is built in an interdisciplinary way, considering criteria for accessibility, usability, data visualization, good code practices and user experience. Its structure is based on the atomic design methodology, which proposes that from simple elements -atoms- complex components and functions -organisms- are formed and, in turn, these form functional and robust templates and user interfaces under the same logic to be able to decompose them if necessary.

By using Sisdai you will be able to explore buttons, menus, graphs, maps, components, and others that will allow you to develop accessible interfaces. Also, if your native language is not English, you will have the opportunity to access documented code in Spanish! Sisdai libraries are developed using open source technologies, such as the Vue.js Javascript framework, OpenLayers, D3.js and Git.

Sisdai enhances the social impact of research projects by promoting technological autonomy and independence with the use of free software components. The Sisdai portal aims to enable as many people as possible to perceive, understand, navigate and interact correctly. This includes those with different disabilities: visual, hearing, motor, cognitive or neurological, as well as older adults and those unfamiliar with the Internet. The code repositories, libraries and documentation that comprise it are developed by Mexican work teams where the Spanish language is privileged. 

There are currently 5 public code libraries in institutional repositories available for research teams.


CONCLUSION

ENI-Gema-Sisdai are open projects in favor of the nation, in which collaborations were carried out with more than a dozen research teams, institutions and public centers. There are more than twenty public portals of the ENI project, about 400 geographic layers with free format downloads in Gema and 5 open source libraries in Sisdai. All this is available in public sites.</abstract>

                <abstract>This presentation shows how QGIS, OpenStreetMap, and other open resources were used to reconstruct narrative maps conveying one woman&#8217;s experience with space and identity in mid-20th-century S&#227;o Paulo. In 1960, the edited diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus, Quarto de Despejo, become one of the best-selling books in Brazil. It vividly portrayed the struggles of a single mother scavenging the streets of the city looking for anything to sell so she could feed her family. Some Brazilians did not believe that a Black woman from a &#8220;favela&#8221; neighborhood could have composed such a poetically poignant manuscript, but more recent scholarship has confirmed the authenticity of Carolina&#8217;s authorship.  

It is clear that Carolina saw and felt lines of division between her neighborhood and the city not visible on any printed maps of the time. When going into &#8220;the city&#8221; she felt like she was in paradise, or a beautiful guest room; whereas her neighborhood on the precarious margins of the Tiet&#234; River was viewed as the backyard trash heap, subject to environmental hazards and government neglect. In this talk, I use narrative maps to show how these different places in Carolina&#8217;s life were constructed and what they each meant to her.  

In order to better understand Carolina&apos;s relationship to the spaces she called &#8220;the favela&#8221; and &#8220;the city&#8221;, I carefully constructed a list of every place mentioned in Quarto de Despejo. Employing a combination of archival research, Internet searches, onsite visits, and modern GIS databases, our research team located and mapped as many of these locations as possible, using QGIS software. For a base layer, we fashioned a historical street grid by starting with OpenStreetMap and modifying the geometries to conform to old aerial photographs freely available online. We then used our newly-created databases to compose narrative maps of Carolina&#8217;s S&#227;o Paulo, focusing on areas where she did and did not go, as well as places where she experienced different kinds of emotions, challenges, access to resources, and interactions with the state. These maps demonstrate how geographic and social barriers both seen and unseen influenced the daily lives of Paulistanos in the 1950s, a challenge that persists in Brazil today.</abstract>

                <abstract>Brazil&#8217;s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) developed the TerraBrasilis web portal as the main link between the land cover data generated by its projects and a wide range of users. In this talk, we will discuss TerraBrasilis&apos; development, updates, and improvements. We built the portal&apos;s front-end and back-end using free and open-source software.
INPE&#8217;s program named BiomasBR is responsible for long term projects that generate the official data about the Brazilian biomes. These projects process Earth observation satellite images with the goal of generating accurate and timely data to support the country in monitoring and controlling deforestation, forest degradation, forest fire, and other environmental impacts on the Brazilian Amazon forest and other biomes. In this talk, we address specifically the projects PRODES and DETER. The Real Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER) uses Earth observation satellite imagery to map and report changes in forest cover across the Amazon and the Cerrado biome. As a result, DETER produces, every day, sets of polygons, referred to as alerts, that delineate areas where deforestation or degradation (such as mining, forest fire scars, or logging) can be perceived. Each DETER alert includes the image date that generated it, the type of change, and other attributes. DETER uses images from sensors with high temporal resolution and large swath width, with the appropriate spectral bands to detect vegetation cover change. Currently, DETER uses mainly data from the Wild Field Imager (WFI) on board the Amazonia-1 and the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS-4A). Command-and-control organizations use the data produced by DETER to plan and qualify field actions.
The Legal Amazon Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES) maps, annually, the suppression of native vegetation in Brazil. Initially, the project restricted its scope to the Legal Amazon region, conducting an annual inventory of forest loss dating back to 1988. In 2001, the project expanded its scope to include the monitoring of Cerrado biome. PRODES uses medium resolution imagery with the appropriate spectral bands to detect vegetation cover change. It uses images from the Operational Imager (OLI) sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite, the Multispectral Camera (MUX) from CBERS-4 and CBERS-4A, and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) from Sentinel-2. PRODES data has supported long-term public policies to contain native vegetation removal in the Amazon and the Cerrado. Currently, the project has expanded to encompass all Brazilian biomes. PRODES data support public policies, greenhouse gas emission estimates, and can help release international resources associated with conservation, climate, and biodiversity agendas. 
PRODES and DETER generate a large volume of geospatial data useful to a several organizations. Given the strategic importance of these projects, and INPE&#8217;s commitment to geospatial open source and open data, the TerraBrasilis portal is the one-stop point to access PRODES and DETER data.  The portal is used by the Brazilian government, academic and private sectors, non-governmental organisations, and the general public interested in environmental issues. As such, TerraBrasilis is a way to ensure INPE&#8217;s transparency regarding the environmental data it generates. It allows anyone to explore land cover data without requiring further knowledge.
The main functional requirements and characteristics that guide the development of TerraBrasilis are: multiplicity of users, with different technological backgrounds and different interests; data might be subject to temporal embargo before being public; temporal embargo might be overcome by authorized users; data is related to the same process, but has a distinct production timetable and distinct time granularity; data has to be presented as a web map with the conventional operations of zooming, pan, layer selection, etc.; data summaries should be available with common visualization tools such as graphs, charts, and tables; users need to make comparisons over time and different spatial units of interest, such as municipalities, states, indigenous lands, or conservation units; data can be downloaded in open formats; data can be accessed through open geospatial services.
Considering these requirements TerraBrasilis is designed as a set of multiple independent panels, to expose different views of its geospatial database. A series of scripts connect to the production database and prepare the data for publishing in TerraBrasilis. The publishing database contains over 2 PB of raster and vector data, and this volume increases daily. It contains data for Brazil&apos;s entire territory. Some datasets date back to 1988.
PRODES and DETER data are available in distinct web mapping panels that allow the visualization of multiple layers, spatial and temporal filtering, as well as the download of data in open formats such as GeoTIFF and Shapefile. They are also available in interactive dashboards where users can make comparisons over time and different spatial units of interest, such as municipalities, states, or conservation units.
TerraBrasilis uses a service-oriented paradigm that follows interoperable international spatial data standards and the specifications of the Brazilian National Spatial Data Infrastructure (INDE). TerraLib offers Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)-compliant services such as Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Service Coverage (WCS) and Catalog Service for the Web (CSW).
TerraBrasilis publishes all of the data generated in DETER and PRODES, and it is constantly evolving. Recently, the portal has developed and integrated some panels that integrate data from PRODES and DETER, along with other data sources such as INPE&apos;s vegetation fire monitoring project in Brazil. The Situation Room panel, for example, allows the observation of critical areas of deforestation and vegetation fire, through a series of indicators based on data from DETER and other environmental indicators. In this talk, we will provide a general overview of the portal, the technical aspects of its development, and the data presented in TerraBrasilis.</abstract>

                <abstract>Illegal gold mining in the Amazon rainforest has escalated dramatically, resulting in deforestation, pollution, and violence against indigenous communities. This talk will explore how AI and open-source geospatial software are being used to combat this environmental crisis. We will delve into the methodologies and technologies behind Amazon Mining Watch&apos;s (AMW) efforts to monitor and mitigate illegal mining activities. By integrating machine learning models with satellite data and open-source tools, AMW provides insights that empower local activists and influence policy changes. 

This session will cover the following topics:
- Overview of the environment and social impacts of illegal mining and challenges of detection
- The technological approach, beginning with purpose built machine learning models and tracing the evolution to the foundational models used today. 
- Current architecture and open source components for data processing
- The use of open data, data processing strategies and information on accessing (for free!) over 100TB of processed imagery and embeddings generated to date
- Live demo of the next-gen platform
- Q/A

                <abstract>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become indispensable tools in public administration, providing essential insights for decision-making. My talk will showcase the application of R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, in creating detailed maps that reveal critical socio-economic and environmental patterns across Brazil. Our work primarily focuses on public health, education, environmental issues, and economic development, demonstrating the transformative power of open-source GIS in governmental institutions.

The data sources for our analysis are primarily open data repositories provided by the government, NGOs, and private institutions. We integrate various datasets, including public expenditure, municipal influence, population, and hospital locations. Statistical tools such as clustering, centrality measures, correlation, chi-square tests, and distribution measures are employed to identify patterns and produce significant graphical elements. We utilize R packages like {geobr} and {spdata} for accessing thematic shapefiles, including states, municipalities, municipal seats, and biomes. Our mapping projects often stem from requests by institutions such as the National Treasury Secretariat and the Vice-Presidency of the Republic, as well as spontaneous contributions to the data science ecosystem.

One of our key findings relates to healthcare access. Cities with low management capacity and influence are typically associated with significant travel distances for hospital care. In the realm of education and human development, public education policies have reshaped the municipal HDI map of Brazil between 1991 and 2010, particularly in the Northeast. In Cear&#225;, education improvements were pivotal in enhancing HDI from 1991 to 2010. The impact of COVID-19 has also been a critical area of focus. By the first anniversary of the epidemic, numerous Brazilian municipalities reported death tolls nearing the total deaths observed from 2014 to 2018.

Climate change exacerbates natural disaster issues in Brazil, notably floods and droughts in Rio Grande do Sul and the Amazon region. Despite most Brazilian homes having at least one bathroom, maps reveal that the North region and Maranh&#227;o still have many municipalities with low proportions of homes with bathrooms. Conversely, the South and Southeast regions, especially S&#227;o Paulo, show high proportions of residences with access to central water supply networks. When considering environmental pressure, many Global South countries see their HDI positions improve, while the Global North, notably Canada, experiences a significant decline.

Economic analysis reveals that in Brazil, five clusters of municipalities are formed based on municipal GDP components. Maps highlight patterns associated with agricultural strength in the West, wealth in S&#227;o Paulo, and significant economic deprivation in the Northeast and northern Minas Gerais. On a broader scale, Brazil stands out with the largest GDP growth in South America from 1960 to 2023, while Argentina and Venezuela have seen their shares plummet, and Chile remains stable.

The maps generated serve multiple purposes. They are integral to storytelling, dashboards, and publications on platforms like Medium. Some maps are intended solely for internal use by the requesting institutions. Many projects have their codes available on GitHub or Gist, promoting transparency and collaboration within the data science community.

Our work demonstrates the profound impact of using open-source GIS tools in governmental institutions. The ability to visualize and analyze complex data sets in a spatial context has enabled more informed decision-making and public policy development. By sharing our methods and findings, we aim to inspire other governmental bodies to adopt similar practices, ultimately fostering greater transparency and efficiency in public administration.</abstract>

                <abstract>This talk explores how the Brazilian Federal Police leverages FOSS4G to integrate and visualize data from Brasil MAIS, a multi-million dollar environmental monitoring program, using our custom-built Inteligeo platform.

Brasil MAIS monitors over 2.9 million km&#178; weekly - about 34% of Brazil&apos;s vast 8.5 million km&#178; territory. To manage the resulting massive amounts of satellite imagery and environmental change alerts, we developed Inteligeo, a GeoNode-based solution currently in production at the Federal Police and in various stages of adoption across multiple government agencies.

We&apos;ll discuss:
1. Building Inteligeo on FOSS4G principles (GeoNode, PostGIS, GDAL, GeoServer, FastAPI) to enable seamless data integration across government agencies.
2. Implementing user-friendly tools for non-specialists and integrating with Gov.br authentication.
3. Using FastAPI for complex integrations, such as streamlining access to the XYZ data provider for Brasil Mais.
4. Technical challenges in scaling Brasil MAIS to handle 46 million monthly tile views and serve 500+ public institutions and 100,000+ users.
5. The crucial sponsorship of the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services (MGI) in developing Inteligeo 5 since 2021, and their plans for its independent use.

Brasil MAIS has already demonstrated significant impact, contributing to over R$16 billion ($2.8 billion USD) in environmental crime-related fines and asset freezes. While Inteligeo is still ramping up adoption, it aims to compound this impact by enhancing the efficiency of data utilization. We anticipate measuring Inteligeo-specific results in the coming year, showcasing how FOSS4G solutions can amplify the effectiveness of large-scale environmental monitoring programs.

We&apos;ll conclude by examining how this integration serves as a model for similar global initiatives in environmental management and welcome input from the FOSS4G community on further improvements.</abstract>

                <abstract>To showcase the application of free and open-source software (FOSS) in the census cartography works produced within the scope of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 

Currently linked to the Ministry of Planning and Budget, IBGE is a federal public administration entity. Since its foundation in 1936, it has become the main provider of data and information in the country, meeting the needs of various segments of civil society as well as federal, state, and municipal government entities. Its institutional mission is &quot;to portray Brazil by providing the information required to the understanding of its reality and the exercise of citizenship&quot;. To achieve this, it identifies and analyzes the territory, counts the population, shows economic evolution through people&#8217;s work and production, while also revealing how they live. 

To support this purpose, IBGE maintains the Territorial Base (TB), a spatial information system supporting the operations of collection, processing, analysis, tabulation, charts, cartograms, and publications of its surveys and censuses. It is also used for evaluations of population estimates by identifying, monitoring, and representing the evolution of the territory, mainly through the development of its census sector network. 

The TB consists of a graphical base of georeferenced information representing territorial structures, census tracts (called sectors) and other elements. These structures can be legal, such as the political-administrative division; analytical, linked to territorial patterns or specific population groups; or operational, intended to guarantee access to and coverage of census units. 

Among the territorial structures that comprise the TB, the census sector underpins the operational organization of censuses and some sample surveys. It is a territorial interview collection unit whose size and number of households and establishments allow the census taker to complete their activities within a specified timeframe. Moreover, it is the basic unit for disseminating census information, allowing public access to statistical results at the smallest spatial range. 
 
In mid-2014, IBGE was moving from a data update model based on a complete review conducted just before a census operation to a continuous update model, which was more complex and required more agile tools and systems for operators. At that time, however, the software used by the TB was commercial, with the update and customization processes for the entity&apos;s specific objectives being slow and difficult, as they were tied to contracts with the supplier. This represented a considerable, often prohibitive, expense for public coffers.  

Concurrently, a staff of analysts had formed within IBGE, coming from civil service exams held in previous years for specialized technical jobs. These servers had two synergistic qualities: methodological knowledge of the activities performed by the institution, and some had technical capabilities in systems development. 

Given the scenario, it became feasible to explore an internal alternative for TB update activities. Such a system should meet these technological premises: 

Be based on a free platform without licensing costs, preferably with an open-source codebase to avoid future dependencies; 

Operate with low computational and network requirements to meet the diverse realities of users; 

Be fully customizable to adapt to the needs of the TB and IBGE. 

Given such requirements and considering the technical knowledge and stage of evolution of geoprocessing tools at the time, the system was defined as an external plugin for QGIS (using pyQGIS API) with a graphical interface modeled in Qt framework (using pyQt API). 

The Geographic Information System for the Territorial Base (SIGBT), therefore, is the technological solution that emerged in 2014. Its conception, implementation, and homologation stages were always characterized by constant collaborative development, where TB technicians and related areas of IBGE could participate and contribute in several ways, from signaling problems to suggesting improvements and even writing the code itself. The development of SIGBT was designed modularly, to meet the methodological and conceptual priorities defined by IBGE. 

Its code was primarily written in Python, and the handled data is managed by an SQLite database (with SpatiaLite extension), made available to internal users for download and offline editing from a versioned Git repository. 

Among the main procedures performed by SIGBT are the graphical operations on census sectors (divisions, aggregations, adjustments, and ensuring comparability between previous sector grids) and intra-sector layers (localities, roads, blocks, and block faces). It also ensures the topological and methodological consistency of the edits made. Additionally, the production of maps used in census operations is carried out on SIGBT. 

Since the advent of SIGBT, three major data update cycles aimed at census operations have been conducted using the system: the 2015 Population Count (which was eventually canceled), the 2016 Census of Agriculture, and the 2022 Demographic Census (which prompted two update cycles due to two postponements). 

Currently, SIGBT is in use at the IBGE Coordination of Territorial Structures, in all 27 State Superintendencies, and in most of its over 560 agencies. It comprises about 50 specific functions that automate processes, facilitate edits, and enable the continuous updating of the TB. The system also integrates information from other databases from different areas that interact with the TB, enabling integrated editing and visualization of all data, thus facilitating the construction of territorial occupation indicators at the national level. 

Looking towards the future of SIGBT, the development of new modules for public access is being considered. It is projected that these modules will leverage QGIS navigation resources to offer citizens easier and quicker access to geographic data published by IBGE. 

  

Final Considerations 

The explanation above showcases, through IBGE&apos;s experience with SIGBT, the feasibility of using a free software architecture for complex geographical projects with a wide range of geographic applications.  

From a budgetary perspective, the superiority of free software was also verified, as SIGBT has contributed estimated savings that would exceed six figures since its creation, solely from software licensing that is no longer used. 

The SIGBT initiative, therefore, presents itself as a successful example of a system based on free and open-source software, developed by public administration, showing that the use of this type of structure is not only viable but desirable.</abstract>

                <abstract>The newly established Copernicus Global Land Cover and Tropical Forest Mapping and Monitoring service (LCFM), coordinated by the European Commission&apos;s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and implemented by a consortium led by VITO, marks a significant advancement in land cover mapping. Building on the 100 m Copernicus Global Land Cover layers (2015-2019), LCFM integrates insights from ESA&#8217;s WorldCover and Horizon2020 REDDCopernicus projects to deliver a dynamic global land cover service at 10 m resolution for the years 2020-2026.

LCFM will provide global sub-annual (i.e., monthly) land surface features and categories at 10 m resolution, consolidating them into annual land cover maps and tropical forest monitoring products. These data products will be of high quality, free, and open to all users in line with the principles of the Copernicus program. Additionally, LCFM will also release the training data used in its workflows, supporting transparency and fostering further research and development within the community.

A key aspect of LCFM is its foundation on open-source software. Production processes will be conducted on the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and will be based on the Python ecosystem and the openEO platform. The processing workflows and developed software will be open-sourced and released together with the data products ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

In this presentation, we will introduce the LCFM service and showcase the first data products which will be publicly released in the beginning of 2025.  We will highlight the improvements the service brings and explore its potential for downstream applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>In 2015, the City of S&#227;o Paulo launched GeoSampa, a platform providing access to a variety of cadastral data, maps, satellite images, and information on zoning, land use, urban infrastructure, land subdivision, and public areas for both municipal technicians and the general public. GeoSampa serves as a data repository, allowing different departments to share their information and keep it updated on the platform. A notable example is the Licensing Department, which in 2015 presented a geographic database solution using open-source software, with Linux, Postgres, PostGIS, Python, and QGIS, for land subdivision processes. These initiatives solved major problems and streamlined work processes, highlighting the importance of a data-sharing culture among public agencies for urban development.
The work developed by the Licensing Department was summarized in the experience cataloged by CEBRAP in a program called COPI-COLA, whose content can be seen in full on the CEBRAP website  https://cebrap.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Guia_5.pdf. This program adopted an innovative approach by using open-source software to develop and maintain the system, significantly reducing implementation costs and making team work more efficient and integrated. Other areas also benefited from the organized and available information on GeoSampa, serving as an example for public agencies across the country.
This work specifically aims to show two technical examples of codes used in the Geographic Database mentioned above, which I developed, highlighting the practical benefits of collaboration and technological innovation in the public sector using open-source software.
Example 1
According to Ordinance No. 957/GC3 of 2015, issued by the Brazilian Aeronautics Command (COMAER), guidelines are established for the creation and management of Airport Protection Zones (ZPA). The objective is to ensure the safety and efficiency of air operations by preventing obstacles and activities that could interfere with air navigation. The ordinance details the competencies of municipalities and other bodies in monitoring and controlling these areas, as well as defining specific restrictions for land use near airports.
Due to the large volume of licensing requests, if all enterprises were subject to DECEA&apos;s evaluation, there would be a need to increase DECEA&apos;s team, resulting in approval delays. To mitigate this problem, the implementation of a geographic system, to be used by the City of S&#227;o Paulo, could select only cases in regions where DECEA&apos;s action was necessary.
A system using Linux, Postgres, PostGIS, and QGIS was developed by the department&apos;s technicians with validation from DECEA&apos;s technicians. This optimized processes, reducing DECEA&apos;s workload and shortening approval times. Our objective is to briefly present how this system was developed and its impact on time savings and information security.
Example 2
The work consisted of creating an algorithm to comply with Article 131 of Law No. 16.402/2016. &quot;The use of properties, for the purposes of land subdivision, use, and occupation discipline, is classified as permitted or not permitted and as compliant or non-compliant. &#167; 2&#186; Use not permitted in the location is that which cannot be implemented or installed on the property due to the zone and the street width.&quot; Street width is defined as the distance between property alignments, including the carriageway and public walkway.
We used the cartographic bases of the City of S&#227;o Paulo, surveyed in 2004, for geoprocessing. The tool used was the QGIS software (Geographic Information System - GIS), the official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). The Licensing and Urban Development Department&apos;s (SMUL) database on street widths at the time (2018) covered between 35% and 40% of the city&apos;s streets. The database had low reliability, as measurements were taken randomly at three different points on the street segment, making it visually impossible to pinpoint where the width is smallest, thus preventing proper application of the above law. Measurements not included in this database would be taken in loco by subprefecture technicians and sent to the Licensing Department&apos;s Cadastre Division for completion. This database gathered measurements taken over time and was not available to the public.
The work presented here was developed using scripts in PyQGIS, which combines the Python programming language with QGIS APIs, allowing for automated geometry tracing. The created code used all street segments and traced all elevations from the nodes created in the block layers, choosing the minimum elevation. This work does not eliminate the need for in loco measurements, but like in Example 1, selects the necessary cases, significantly reducing the number of visits and increasing reliability for proper law enforcement.
Conclusion
The success of GeoSampa and associated projects reveals that using open-source tools promotes transparency and accessibility of geographic information, strengthening citizen participation and facilitating urban planning, making cities smarter and more sustainable.
As a developer of this project, I feel immense pride in having contributed to this digital and technological transformation in public administration. Seeing the positive impact of our work is extremely gratifying.
Ultimately, S&#227;o Paulo&apos;s example can inspire other cities to adopt similar practices, contributing to a future where technology and innovation serve efficient and inclusive urban development. Thus, the cartographic transition from map library to geoprocessing marks a new era in public administration, where geographic information is a valuable resource for decision-making and improving quality of life in cities.</abstract>

                <abstract>In a humanitarian context, data collection can be divided into two main categories: proactive collection of data that may be useful for disaster response and recovery; reactive collection that is required to assess the situation on the ground during an event.

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has supported both types of mapping through the Tasking Manager platform. Going forward we will also be able to collect drone imagery collaboratively and add collected field-data to complement and match to the remote data, with the Drone TM and Field Mapping TM (FMTM) respectively.

There are often major hurdles for field-based data collection:
1.  	How to effectively collaborate with multiple data collectors at the same time.
2.  	How to work when there is poor connectivity in an area.

Web applications may be an acceptable choice to solve the first issue, but typically perform poorly when subjected to the second.

With a new paradigm in web development, local-first applications, this may no longer be an issue.

We can develop web-based applications that allow for both:
-          Real-time update for users undertaking collaborative data collection campaigns.
-          Fully offline data collection capability, with syncing and conflict resolution once connectivity is restored.

These capabilities have been achieved through some major landmarks over time:
-          Addition of WASM to the browser in 2017.
-          Implementation of databases in the web-browser (SQLite, Postgres), using WASM.
-          Introduction of smart data reconciliation mechanisms such as CRDTs.
-          Continual improved access to mobile phones globally, particularly in the introduction of high-performance smart phones.

This talk explores our journey implementing a local-first field mapping flow, with an example and demo to demonstrate its efficacy.</abstract>

                <abstract>In this presentation, we will explore a practical example of using GeoServerCloud within a local cluster, specifically focusing on catalog configuration in the database. We&apos;ll simplify the complex process of deploying an application in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. This task is challenging, especially when the application has a microservices architecture. Our goal is to bridge the technical gap, ensuring developers don&apos;t need to become DevOps experts to integrate GeoServerCloud into their applications.</abstract>

                <abstract>The integration of open-source data into climate policy has immense potential to enhance climate adaptation and mitigation efforts globally. This talk addresses the existing gaps in the utilization of open-source data by decision-makers and explores sustainable funding models for these initiatives. 

 Case Studies:

1. Assessing Climate-Related Disaster Damage Using EMDAT:
   The Emergency Events Database (EMDAT) provides critical open-source data on the damage caused by climate-related disasters. This data is invaluable for developing countries to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize areas for climate adaptation funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). By using EMDAT, countries can make informed decisions to prevent future damage and allocate resources more effectively.

2. Using OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data for Small Island Developing States:
   In small island developing states (SIDS), the use of OSM data has been instrumental in assessing average travel times to urban centers. This analysis highlighted the high transactional costs due to fragmented geographies, providing policymakers with concrete evidence to address these challenges. By leveraging OSM data, these countries can improve infrastructure planning and reduce costs, enhancing their resilience to climate impacts.

 Focus Areas:

1. Gaps in Competencies:
   Despite the availability of valuable open-source data, there remains a significant gap in its usage by policymakers. Data specialists often conduct in-depth analyses that are not easily accessible or understandable to policymakers. Bridging this gap requires improved collaboration and communication between data specialists and policymakers.

2. Enhancing Data Literacy:
   Policymakers need better data literacy to fully utilize the benefits of open-source data. Training and capacity-building initiatives can empower them to make data-driven decisions, fostering a culture of evidence-based policy-making in climate adaptation and mitigation.

3. Sustainable Funding for Open Source Initiatives:
   Many open-source projects suffer from intermittent funding, threatening their sustainability. Innovative funding models, such as public-private partnerships, crowdfunding, and subscription-based services, can ensure continuous support and development of open-source data platforms.

Challenges for Small Landmass Countries:
   Countries with small landmasses, particularly SIDS, often face limitations in accessing open-source data due to satellite coverage gaps and network connectivity issues. Addressing these challenges requires tailored solutions, such as deploying drones for localized data collection and improving internet infrastructure.

Conclusion:
   To maximize the benefits of open-source data for climate action, it is crucial to close the competency gap between data specialists and policymakers. By enhancing data literacy among policymakers and ensuring sustainable funding for open-source initiatives, countries can better harness these tools to develop robust, data-driven climate policies. This talk aims to shed light on these critical issues and propose actionable solutions to bridge existing gaps and promote effective climate decision-making.</abstract>

                <abstract>Codeando Mexico is a Mexican non-profit organization, with 11 years of experience, that works with technology and data for the public good. Our goal is to build better societies by building and contributing to sustainable and useful tech / data projects. 
We strongly believe in participatory, community-led projects that leverage tech and data to find solutions for our societies&#8217; most pressing issues. We have spent the last decade building sustainable digital tools, opening up our tech and data, collaborating with other teams and contributing to amazing open-source projects. 
As part of our work, we act as technical partners to communities that require assistance. We are aware that the communities themselves are the experts in the problems we are trying to solve. To do this, we mostly take advantage of great open-source digital tools that are already available. 
For this talk, we would like to present three projects, talk about the lessons learned and provide insights on how to better collaborate between communities. In these collaborations we face similar challenges: How to integrate different skill levels to crowdmapping projects? How to structure participation to ensure data quality? How to help our partners better communicate and amplify the job they are undertaking? How to find a common language? How to create better relationships between tech, data, and problem-focused communities?
Throughout the presentation we will talk about 3 projects:
8M Map - Collaboration to improve the workflow from mapping to visualization of the activities around the globe for the 8M Geochicas International Women&apos;s Day 2024. 
Mapea tu Cuadra (map your block) - A collaboration with URBE, a local collective of urbanists, to map security and micro mobility infrastructure in their neighborhoods. 
EcoZonas - Ongoing collaboration with WRI and the Wuppertal Institute to help neighborhoods map and identify climate disaster risks in their communities. 
We will showcase the technologies and lessons learned, as well as useful strategies to build better collaborations.</abstract>

                <abstract>As geospatial data systems grow in scale and complexity, automating the deployment, scaling, and management of geospatial servers becomes increasingly critical. This talk presents Quarticle&#8217;s innovative solution to automating GeoServer management using Kubernetes (K8S) operators. GeoServer is a powerful open-source server for sharing geospatial data, but its deployment and management in cloud-native environments can pose challenges.

We will dive into how Quarticle, a company specializing in cloud-native applications and geospatial data solutions, developed a Kubernetes Operator tailored for GeoServer. This operator simplifies the management of GeoServer instances, enabling seamless automated deployments, scaling, updates, and configuration management in a Kubernetes environment.</abstract>

                <abstract>Since 2015, thousands of university students across the world have joined the YouthMappers network, creating and using open geospatial data to address local and global development challenges. At over 410 universities in 78 countries&#8212;including 60 chapters in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean&#8212;student-led YouthMappers chapters leverage free, open-source geospatial tools to map their communities and priority regions. This presentation explores the confluence of factors that have enabled university youth spanning diverse identities, academic backgrounds, and languages to successfully engage in YouthMappers activities and with the broader open mapping community. The presentation also discusses the challenges that YouthMappers students face in applying open mapping methods and tools to their work. It features the lived experiences of YouthMappers students, particularly in the Latin American context, and foregrounds topics of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.

YouthMappers chapters collaborate with the US Agency for International Development, humanitarian organizations like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, local and federal governments, NGOs, and other partners to address gaps in geospatial data. Students map areas both in person using open survey tools and remotely using satellite imagery. Ultimately, the open data that they collect and publish power development interventions, disaster response, and digital ecosystem growth, largely in low- and middle-income countries. The key to the YouthMappers network&#8217;s expansive growth and impact is its sense of community. For many students, YouthMappers is their initial introduction to open GIS software and its real-world applications. Students build their open mapping skills through peer-to-peer learning within the network and with mentorship from individuals in the larger FOSS4G ecosystem.

As a testament to the power of the network, YouthMappers students have collectively contributed over 24 million edits to OpenStreetMap since 2015. Advancements in open mapping software, such as improved options for low-connectivity environments and non-English-speaking users, have enabled YouthMappers students from a greater range of backgrounds to participate in open mapping. The YouthMappers network has also contributed to building FOSS4G tools, such as OSM Teams. This presentation highlights these successes and calls for continued mutually beneficial partnerships between YouthMappers chapters and the broader FOSS4G community.

This talk is rooted in a book chapter of the same name co-authored by the three presenters. The chapter will be published in the forthcoming open-access book Open Movements: Recognizing Challenges and Building Connections.</abstract>

                <abstract>Map Kibera arose from a desire to expand OSM beyond the confines of Europe and North America. In 2009, it pushed the boundaries of what then-new technologies could do. What have the mappers learned over the years? This talk will welcome you to Nairobi and through the ups and downs of mapping in Kenya - from the history of mapping in 20th Kenya, through Map Kibera&#8217;s start, into slums and rural parts of Kenya, and finally to current-day Kibera, where mappers are mapping street lights, waste disposal, schools, and more. How has Map Kibera and OSM had a community impact even as drones, satellite technology and AI are revolutionizing mapping? What has changed, and what has remained the same?  We will discuss the global impact of Map Kibera, on community-based mapping in OSM and on the general application of technology in developing countries. 
This talk will include a discussion of mapping in Kenya dating back to the colonial era, the establishment of Kibera as a region of Nairobi, and its growth into a massive informal settlement. Kibera has been viewed as a place to develop by the Kenya government, International aid agencies, charities, and missionaries. It was a flashpoint of the post-election violence of 2007/8.
Map Kibera&#8217;s Kenyan leaders will discuss the most recent mapping and local impacts made by the use of OSM. Mapping of street lights in Kibera led to new and more street lights installed in Kibera. Mapping of waste management in Mukuru led to the placement of dumping waste bins. Data on schools has led to a pilot project to install solar panels on selected schools. None of these impacts have been easy, but we will share lessons learned about OSM, open data and communities.

                <abstract>QWC2 (QGIS Web Client 2) is the official web application of QGIS, that allows you to publish your projects with the same rendering, thanks to QGIS Server. The environment is composed of a modern responsive front-end written in JavaScript on top of ReactJS and OpenLayers, and several server-side Python/Flask micro-services to enhance the basic functionalities of QWC2 and QGIS Server.

QWC2 is modular and extensible, and provides both an off-the-shelf web application and a development framework: you can start simple and easy with the demo application, and then customize your application at will, based on your needs and development capabilities.

This talk aims at introducing this application and to show how easy it is to publish your own QGIS projects on the web. An overview of the QWC2 architecture will also be given. It will also be an opportunity to discover the last new features that have been developed in the past year and ideas for future improvements.</abstract>

                <abstract>The lack of an integrated understanding of the connections between extreme weather events, environmental degradation, socioeconomic disparities, and their impacts on infectious disease outbreaks heightens the risk of disease spread. This issue is particularly critical in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, where vulnerable communities have been more frequently affected by these events. The HARMONIZE project goal is to create digital toolkits that stakeholders in climate change hotspots can use to combine data about the environment, climate and health cost-effectively to monitor and send out alerts about a set of diseases that are affected by its effect.

This talk will give an overview of the Earth Observation Data Cube tuned for Health Response Systems (EODCtHRS), an HARMONIZE Project component. The EODCtHRS presents a technical-scientific proposal termed HARMONIZE Instance composed of back/front-end solutions developed using free and open-source software for integration and interoperability between specific sets of health, environmental and climate data and the digital infrastructure of the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). 

The development of this proposal was divided into four working streams, Drone, Health, Climate, and Data Science Environment modules. Furthermore, we developed a custom version of the web platform for data visualization and analysis of these sources based on BDC Explorer 3.0 (https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/portal/explore), which presents improved capabilities for discovering, visualizing, and downloading data cubes from remote sensing images (https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/harmonize/dev/portal/explore). An Harmonize Instance ALPHA Version has been generated.

The core background of this platform is the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification which defines a way to store and search data using spatial and temporal operations. The STAC enables the harmonization of data from different sources and maintains interoperability between all system parts. The solution utilizes a suite of technologies from  Python and R environments in addition to PostgreSQL/PostGIS and GeoServer needed to store and publish data collections.

Below we present a brief description of each working stream:

Module 1 - Drone image: The main goal of drone image integration in the context of EODCtHRS is to provide a data infrastructure that meets the demands of health surveillance, especially in areas considered hotspots of climate change. Consequently, we started exploring the integration of the images generated by fieldwork campaigns in some locations of Par&#225; State. The processing of these images is based on auxiliary information (course angle and flight height) and EXIF and TIFF metadata tags to support the conversion of the raw images into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files ideal for integration with STAC specification implemented by BDC infrastructure. Besides that, mosaics were created using the OpenDroneMap application.  The Alpha version of these data collections (scenes/mosaics) has been published as layers with GeoServer and associated metadata available in STAC catalogs.

Module 2 - Health data: This module integrates health data for the EODCtHRS, including information from different stakeholders, mainly Fiocruz&apos;s Health Information Laboratory (LIS) and the InfoDengue initiative. Both projects produce health indicators, considering the impacts of environmental and climate change on the Brazilian population. The module also covers the development of two main packages.

The first, called EODCtHRS Health Indicator Processing (EHIPR), was developed in Python to obtain health indicators from CSV and Parquet files, aggregate them spatially and temporally, spatialize them and accommodate them on the HARMONIZE platform . Second, called EODCtHRS Data PUblisher (EDPU), is a package developed in Python to publish the HARMONIZE datasets as a layer in GeoServer and its metadata in STAC Catalog to make available at the HARMONIZE Explorer. All sources of data (drone images, climate and health indicators) used the EDPU package to publish the ALPHA version of collections produced in the context of the HARMONIZE project. 

Module 3 - Climate data: This module integrates climatological data for EODCtHRS, enabling direct query execution via access interfaces, and eliminating the need for data transfer. Within the project&apos;s scope, we consider products produced by Fiocruz team from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which the European Centre implements for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset and available by the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE): SAMeT and MERGE.
 
This module developed the EODCtHRS R Climate Processing Package (rclimpr) to generate climate indicators. The rclimpr uses scripts to extract indicators like temperature and precipitation from netCDF files through spatial and temporal aggregations (epidemiological weeks and months). It outputs raster files in COG format and vector formats like GeoJSON and Shapefile, providing suitable data formats for analysis and visualization.

Module 4 - The Geospatial Data Science Environment (BDC-Lab) aims to provide a set of geospatial data analysis tools integrated with BDC data, avoiding the necessity to download large amounts of Earth Observation data and allowing researchers to produce deep analysis using tools such as RStudio, QGIS, Metview, VSCode and Jupyter Notebooks with several R and Python geospatial libraries pre-installed. Currently, it is in an experimental phase, where some users are testing its functionalities and providing feedback for its improvement. 

This talk proposal presents an overview of a software environment developed to harmonize Earth observation, environmental, climate, and health data aiming to provide ways to visualize, analyze, monitor, and alert for spreading diseases in climate change hotspots in LAC region. The development of the HARMONIZE Instance has demonstrated the utility of geoservices and technologies, with standard infrastructure and protocols, as an effective way to harmonize different data formats from diverse data sources in the health context.

The HARMONIZE project is financed by the Wellcome Trust (https://wellcome.org) grant number 224694/Z/21/Z, through the  Foundation for Scientific and Technological Development In Health (FIOTEC)  ID Project: ICICT-002-FEX-22 and coordinated by Prof. Rachel Lowe leader of the Global Health Resilience Team in the Earth Sciences Department from  Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).</abstract>

                <abstract>As geospatial data users and developers, we often encounter industry standards for data formats, posing challenges for collaborative projects with sectors like Architecture, Engineering, and Construction, which have diverse data formats and conventions.

Professionals in these fields often struggle with transferring data between QGIS, Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, and other platforms and web services. Speckle, an open source platform simplifies data and model exchange between urban design, architecture, and engineering software, fostering collaboration and automation; it enables this to all happen as a result of a single click! In this presentation, we will share simple workflows using Speckle  to unlock the power of your GIS data.

Speckle&apos;s open nature serves multiple purposes:

- GIS Users: Focus on your tasks and avoid technical data misalignments. Align data location-wise and interoperably, and collaborate in real-time via an interactive web interface with a 3D viewer.

- Developers: Extract real-time data insights, automate workflows and data checks, and build custom apps and integrations using Speckle&apos;s infrastructure (3D viewer, SDKs, data access, and authentication).
- Managers: Gain full control of your data with location- and provider-agnostic server setups, custom data access and permissions, time efficiency gains, change tracking, and dashboards.

Speckle&apos;s flexible schema facilitates easy conversion to and from other native formats and enables  data querying. A recent update includes integration with the OGC API standard, making Speckle data accessible to any client using the OGC API without extra plugins or scripts. This means that a master plan drawn by an architect in AutoCAD can be instantly mapped as a WFS layer via Speckle.

                <abstract>Reflections from a research study on GIS in secondary schools in South Africa resulted in the development of a collaborative certification for high school students. The study showed a need for more research into how GIS can be used more in secondary school pedagogy.  Results of a study done by the author on the status of GIS teaching in secondary schools in South Africa is investigated with the aim to determine if the use of Open Source software such as QGIS and open data such as OSM would facilitate the use of GIS as a teacher intervention. Teachers who participated in the study overwhelming agree that there are numerous benefits to using GIS in the classroom. They also expressed a keen willingness to attend GIS courses and learn more about FOSS4G tools. This study also showed how FOSS4G empowers teachers with the means to create exciting, real and relevant teaching content. A sample group evaluated how practical GIS lessons using QGIS and OSM can be used to teach geospatial skills.
What this research study concluded is that comprehensive teacher training is required to make GIS practical lessons more effective in the classroom. This resulted in the development of a certified GIS course for teachers and the development of a coordinated Project Base Learning (PBL) task, which was named the Geospatial Data Science Certificate (GDSC). The GDSC is sponsored by Kartoza, endorsed by the Independent Examination Board (IEB), the Southern African Geography Teachers&#8217; Association (SAGTA) and the University of Pretoria at a nominal cost to make it accessible to all students.  A pilot project was conducted over 2002 and launched in 2023 and the author believes it is ready to evolve into an international &#8216;Geolympiad&#8217; whereby students can collaborate globally to solve real, pertinent issues.</abstract>

                <abstract>In an era where data is increasingly becoming open and accessible, leveraging this wealth of information effectively is crucial. Our presentation, &quot;Exploring OpenData: dynamic rendering of OvertureMaps with GeoServer and WFS without local storage,&quot; showcases an innovative proof of concept that addresses this need.

This project demonstrates how to efficiently consume and dynamically render geospatial data from OvertureMaps without the necessity of local data storage. By utilizing a Web Feature Service (WFS) gateway, we access OvertureMaps data directly from its original source. This approach eliminates the need for intermediate data storage, reducing overhead and streamlining the process of rendering dynamic maps.

The integration of OvertureMaps with GeoServer through WFS enables real-time data rendering, allowing users to visualize up-to-date geographical information without having to handle large datasets themselves. This method not only enhances data accessibility but also optimizes performance by leveraging the capabilities of GeoServer to render data dynamically on-the-fly.

Our presentation will delve into the technical aspects of implementing this proof of concept, discussing the integration process between OvertureMaps, WFS, and GeoServer.</abstract>

                <abstract>The UN OpenGIS initiative along with OSGeo Foundation organized the OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge where Challenge 2 was to create Workshop material for pgRouting. 

The challenge supports the objectives of the OSGeo UN Committee, i.e. promoting the development and use of open-source software that meets UN needs and supports the aims of the UN. 

pgRouting is not only useful for routing cars on roads but it can also be used to analyze water distribution networks, river flow or the connectivity of an electricity network, etc. 

Currently, this presentation talks about pgRouting addressing one of the Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals of the UN.</abstract>

                <abstract>FOSSGIS e.V. is already 24 years old and has come a long way. FOSSGIS e.V. is very successful. We want to share how we got to where we are.
We want to share our story with you and inspire you or give you ideas.

What FOSSGIS e.V. does:
- Runs an annual conference FOSSGIS &amp; other smaller events
- Networking between users and companies
- Build a strong &amp; vibrant community
- Stimulate discussion in the working groups
- Have fun - community sprints, mapping parties &amp; hacking weekends
- Supports community and projects
- And even more

It would be great to connect and share with other chapters to spread the FOSS4G idea around the world.</abstract>
